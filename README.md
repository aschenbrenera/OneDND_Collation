# OneDND_Collation
This is where I will be maintaining the collated document.

Feedback is welcome but keep in mind the types of feedback I'll be considering:

- Mistakes in transcribing the UA
- Paraphrasing that accidently changes gameplay
- Grammar issues: Spelling, punctuation, etc.
- Suggestions on formatting the material
- Suggestions on paraphrasing the material
