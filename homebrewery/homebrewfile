# One D&D Playtest Collation
This document is to help playtesters.<br>
After the second UA playtest document was released, I wanted to have one place to go to reference all the material for playtesting. Further, I wanted the information organized like an actual PHB. I decided to dediate a few hours to bringing together information into one place, and share with the community for what help it might offer. I intend to incorperate future UA into this 'living document'.

## Legal Stuff
Obviously all of the material inside is pulled from content provided by Wizards of the Coast. Right now this document includes information from 3 sources.

• UA 2022 CHARACTER ORIGINS

• UA 	2022 EXPERT	CLASSES

• System	Reference	Document 5.1 [SRD] (for context)

<br>

This document was created using The Homebrewery: 
https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/. Which is a wonderful tool, that I highly recommend if you make your own homebrew documentation.

## What to expect
This document combines and paraphrases content from the sources to facilitate readability, and easy to access information. Because of this, this text is inherently **NOT RAW** (rules as written). 
90% of what is in this document is just copied and pastied from the UA. 6% is copied from the SRD. 3% is me combining and paraphrasing information together. 1% is me intentionally adding new information that changes the natures of the rules, but is only done where I feel this was an obvious oversight and the original text will still be visible. 

The expectation around information in this document is that it still plays as intended by the UA writers, but due to interpreation may be incorrect.  I threw this together very quickly, and expect there to be mistakes and oversights. Feel free to reach out to me for corrections.

## Contact Me
You can submit corrections or improvements to me via GitHub Issues. Go to github.com and search for 'OneDND_Collation'. I will also start a thread on r/onednd called 'OneDND Playtest Collation'.

#### The types of input I'm looking for
- Mistakes in transcribing the UA
- Paraphrasing that accidently changes gameplay
- Grammar issues: Spelling, punctuation, etc.
- Suggestions on formatting the material
- Suggestions on paraphrasing the material



\column

## Version
Last updated Oct 8th 2022.  Version 0.9.1

### Coming Soon
I'm considering an appendix entry for all of the 'Actions'. 

## How to use this?
As most of this document comes directly from UA, you will just read most sections at face value as UA. I felt it was important to clearly delineate when that is not the case.

### Taken from the SRD
When something is quoted from the SRD, it will be formatted in a way to make it clear it's source.
{{purple,#book,text-align:left,background:#aa88aa55
Information formatted in this way, is pulled directly from the SRD.
}}
:
### Edited by me
When something is paraphrased by me, it will be formatted in a way to make it clear it has been altered.
:
*This information was added or reworded by me,* {color:#D35400} <s> and this information was removed by me</s>, *but the rules of character creation and gameplay should be exactly the same.*{color:#D35400}

### Entirely New
Very rarely, I've seen what appears to be an oversight, where I believe a certain piece of text is missing that changes how the rules would be interpreted. If I add something, knowing it will change the rules, I do so in the following format.
:
UA information `amended with rule changes`.

### Combined
If I bring something in from the SRD and I alter it, the formatting styles are combined.

{{purple,#book,text-align:left,background:#aa88aa55
*Some* {color:#D35400} information formatted in this way, is <s>pulled</s> *copied* {color:#D35400} directly from the SRD.

# Build a Character
This chapter details building a character.

{{note,color:purple
This chapter is not yet enitely covered in the UA, and has no available content in the SRD. 
}}

::

### Choose a Class
A	Class’s	description	includes	a	section	on	how	
to	create	a	member	of	that	Class.	*That	section	
tells	you	how	to	determine	your	Hit	Points,	
	Proficiencies, and 1st-level equipment you	gain
from	the	Class. It also tells you how	to	use	the	multiclassing	
rules	with	the	Class.* {color:#D35400}

### Determining your origin
After	choosing	your	character’s	Class,	it’s	time	
to	consider	the	character’s	origin.	Who	are	the	
character’s	ancestors?	And	how	did	the	
character	spend	the	years	leading	up	to	a	life	of	
adventure?	To	help	answer	those	questions,	you	
need to choose a Race and a Background <s> and a language</s>.

A	character’s	Race	represents	ancestry	and	
confers	game	traits	to	the	character.

A	character’s	Background	is	a	collection	of	
characteristics	that	represent	the	place	and	
occupation	that	were	most	formative for	the	
character. 

Race	and	Background together help bring	
your	character’s	backstory	into	focus, and	they	
distinguish the	character	from	other	members	
of	the	same	Class.	For	example,	two	characters	
might	both	be	members	of	the	Fighter	Class,	but	
if	one	is	a	Human	Guard and	the	other	is	a	
Dwarf Gladiator,	the	two	bring	different	
capabilities	and	flavor	to	the	Class.

<s>After	choosing	a	Race	and	a	Background,	you	
choose	a	language	that	your	character	knows,	in	
addition	to	the	Common	tongue and	whatever	
language	you	gained	from	the	Background you	chose.</s>

The	combination	of	Race and	Background	<s>and	
	languages</s> provides fertile	soil	for	your imagination,	as	you	ponder	your	character’s	
earliest	days	and	imagine	the	character’s	family,	
occupation, hometown,	and	more.

The	Character	Origin	Overview	table	
lists	the	traits your	character	gains	from	Race	
and	Background.

::::::::

##### Character Origin Overview
| Race Trait        | Description |
|:------------------|:-----------------|
| Creature Type     | Every character and monster in the game has a Creature Type.|
| Size              | A character’s Size determines the amount of space the character occupies.|
| Speed             | Speed fuels a character’s movement.|
| Life Span         | This life span is an average for a member of the Race.|
| Special Traits    | Each Race provides special traits—a collection of abilities that characters gain from their ancestors. |

| Background Trait        | Description |
|:------------------|:-----------------|
| Ability Score Bonus | A Background grants a +2 bonus to one ability score and a +1 bonus to a different one.|
| Skill Proficiencies | You get two Skill Proficiencies from a Background.|
| Tool Proficiency    | Each Background gives Tool Proficiency with one tool.|
| Language            | *A Background grants three languages (see rules).* {color:#D35400}|
| Special Traits    | Each Race provides special traits—a collection of abilities that characters gain from their ancestors. |
| Feat                | Each Background provides a 1st-level Feat—a special ability acquired in the character’s past.|
| Equipment           | A Background provides a portion of a character’s starting equipment, with the rest coming from Class.|

### Determine Ability Scores
*Generate 6 abilities scores using your groups preferred method. Then assign them and adjust based on your background and/or other creation choices.*{color:#D35400}

# Classes
This chapter details the playable classes.

Characters who	have	levels	in	a	Class	are exceptional;	most	of	the	inhabitants	of	the multiverse	aren’t	members	of a	Class.

:::::

### Class Group
Each	Class	is	a	member	of	a	Class	Group — a	set of	Classes	that	have	certain	features	and	themes in	common. The	Class	Groups	table	lists	the groups and	summarizes	characteristics	the members	of	a	group	have	in	common.

When	creating	a	party	of	adventurers,	one	way	
to	form	a	well-rounded	group	is	to	include	at	
least	one	member	of	each	Class	Group. That	said,	
mix	and	match	Classes	to	your	heart’s	content!

##### Class Groups
| Group | Classes | Characteristics |
|:------------------|:-----|:-----------------|
| Experts  | Bard, Ranger, Rogues, Artificer      | Polymaths who have the Expertise feature and elements of other Classes |
| Mages    | Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard | Adepts of Arcane magic, focusing on utility and destruction |
| Priests  | Cleric, Druid, Paladin    | Stewards of Divine or Primal magic, focusing on healing, utility, and defense |
| Warriors | Barbarian, Fighter, Monk  | Masters of combat who can deal and endure many wounds |

### Primary Ability
The	primary	ability	of	a	Class	is	critical	to	some	
of	the	Class’s	features,	so	when	you	create	your	
character,	that	ability	is	a	great	place	to	put	one	
of	your	highest	scores.

Similarly,	whenever	you	gain	the	Ability	Score	
Improvement	Feat, consider	increasing	your	
primary	ability.

Finally,	to use	the	multiclassing	rules,	you	
must	have	at	least	a	score	of	13	in	the	primary	
ability	of	all	your	classes.
\column
### Spellcasting Ability
{{background:#aa88aa55
*Spellcasting	ability helps	determine	the	saving throw	DCs	of	spells	cast, and your spell attack modifer.*{color:#D35400}
- Wizards	use	Intelligence as	their	spellcasting	ability
- Clerics,	Druids,	and	Rangers	use	Wisdom	as	their spellcasting	ability
- Bards,	Paladins,	Sorcerers,	and	Warlocks	use	Charisma	as	their	spellcasting	ability
:
- *Spell Save DC = 8	+	your	proficiency	bonus	+ your	spellcasting ability	modifier*{color:#D35400}
- *Spell Attack Modifier = your	proficiency	bonus	+ your	spellcasting ability	modifier*{color:#D35400}
}}
:
### Subclasses
A	Class’s	description	is	followed	by	a	section	
dedicated	to	Subclasses	for	that	Class.	A	Subclass	
represents	an	area	of	specialization	for	a	
member	of a Class,	and	the	Subclass	grants	
special	features	at	certain	levels.

*You	can	use	a	Subclass	from	an	older	source,	
such	as	the	2014	Player’s	Handbook or	Tasha’s	
Cauldron	of	Everything.  After you gain the Subclass (At level 3 for all UA classes), follow the subclass level progression for features. For example a Rogue Assassin will still get Infiltration Expertise at 9th-level.*{color:#D35400}

# Bard
This section details the bard class.  

Invoking	magic	through	music,	dance,	and	verse,
Bards are	expert	at	inspiring others, soothing	hurts, disheartening foes,	and	creating illusions.

Bards	believe that	the	creators	of	the	multiverse	spoke and	signed it into	existence
and	that	remnants of	those Words	of	Creation	still	resound	and	glimmer	on	every	plane	of	
existence.	The	magic of	Bards	is	an	attempt	to	harness	those	words—which	transcend	any	
language—and	direct	them	to	create	new	wonders.

Almost	anything	can	inspire	a	new	song	or	tale,	so	Bards	are	fascinated	by	almost	
everything.	They	have	a	wide-ranging	knowledge	of	many	subjects	and	develop	an	aptitude	to do	almost	anything	well.	Bards	become	masters	of	many things,	including musical	performance,	the	workings	of	magic,	and	the	formation	of	jests. 

Not	every	singer or	poet in	a	tavern	or	jester in	a	royal	court	is	a	Bard.	Harnessing the	Words	of	Creation requires	hard	work and	some	measure	of	natural	talent	that	most	troubadours	and jongleurs	lack.	It	can	sometimes	be	hard	to	spot	the	difference	between	these	performers	and	Bards,	though.	A	Bard’s	life	is	spent	wandering	across	the	land	gathering	lore,	telling	stories,	and	living	on	the	gratitude	of	audiences,	much like	any	other	entertainer.	But	Bards’ depth	of	knowledge,	level	of	musical	skill,	and	mastery of	magic	sets	them apart.

### Creating a Bard
To	create	a	Bard,	consult	the	*information in this section* {color:#D35400}.  Then	look	at	the	Bard table	to see	the	Class Features you	get	at	each	level in	this	Class.	The	 descriptions	of	those	features	appear	in the Bard “Class Features”	section.

**Class Group:** :: Expert
**Primary Ability:** :: Charisma
#### Hit Points

#### Armor Training
Light Armor

#### Proficiencies
**Weapons:** :: Simple Weapons
**Tools:**   :: Three Musical Instruments of your choice
**Saving Throws:** :: Charisma, Dexerity
**Skills:**        :: *Any three skills of your choice <br>&emsp;(Recommended: Deception, Performance, Persuasion)* {color:#D35400}

#### Equipment
As	a	1st-level	character,	you	start	with	the	
following	equipment,	or	you	can	forgo	it	and	
spend	100	GP	on	equipment	of	your	choice.

Dagger, Entertainer’s Pack, Leather Armor, Musical Instrument (one of your choice), Shortsword, 18 GP

#### Multiclassing and the Bard
*Here’s	what	you	need	to	know	if	you	choose	Bard	as	one	of	your	Classes when multiclassing.*{color:#D35400}

**Ability	Score	Minimum.** As	a	multiclass	character,	you	must	have a	score	of at	least	13	in	
the	Bard’s	primary	ability,	Charisma,	to	take	a	level	in	this	Class	or	to	take	a	level	in	another	Class	if	you	are	already	a	Bard.

**Armor	Training.** When	you	gain	your	first	Bard	level,	you	gain	Light	Armor	Training

**Proficiencies.** If	Bard	isn’t	your	initial	Class,	here	are the	Proficiencies	you	gain	when	you take	your	first	Bard	level: One	Skill	of	your	choice, and	one	Musical	Instrument	of	your	choice. 

**Spell	Slots.** Add	all	your	Bard	levels	to	the	 appropriate	levels	from	other	Classes	to	
determine	your	available	Spell	Slots for	casting	 Spells,	as	detailed	in	the	multiclassing rules.

You	prepare	Spells	for	each	of	your	Classes	individually,	referring	to the	Spell	Slots	of an	
individual Class	to	determine	the	number	and	levels	of	the	Spells	you	prepare	for	it.

\column
## Class Features
As	a	Bard,	you	gain	the	following	Class	Features	
when	you	reach	the	specified	levels	in	this	Class.	
These	features	are	listed	on	the	Bard table.

### Bardic Inspiration
*Levels: 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th*

You	can supernaturally inspire	others	through	
words,	music,	or	dance.	This	inspiration	is	
represented	by	your	Bardic	Inspiration	die,	
which	is a	d6 at 1st level.

**At	Higher	Levels.**	Your	Bardic	Inspiration	die	
changes	when	you	reach	certain	levels	in	this	
Class,	as	shown	in	the	Bardic	Die	column	of	the	
Bard	table.	The	die	becomes	a	d8	at	5th	level,	a	
d10	at	10th	level,	and	a	d12	at	15th	level.

**Number	of	Uses.** *You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.*{color:#D35400}

**Using	Bardic	Inspiration.** You	can	use	your	
Bardic	Inspiration	die	in	the	following	ways:
**Boost	a	d20	Test.** :: When another	creature	within	60	feet	of	you that	you	can	see	or	hear fails a d20	Test, you	can	use	your	Reaction	to	give	the	creature	a Bardic	Inspiration	die.	The creature	rolls that	die and	adds the	number	rolled	to	the	d20,	potentially	turning	the	failure	into	a	success.
**Heal.** :: Immediately	after another	creature	within	60	feet	of	you that	you	can	see	or	hear takes	damage,	you	can	use	your	Reaction	to	roll	your Bardic	Inspiration die and	restore a	number	of	Hit	Points	to	the	creature	equal	to	the	number rolled.

### Spellcasting
*Levels: 1st, see Bard Table for Spells at each level*

You	have	learned	to	cast	Spells	through	your	
bardic	arts.	See	the	Spellcasting chapter for	the	
rules	on	spellcasting.	The	information	below	
details	how	you	use	those	rules	as	a	Bard.

**Spellcasting	Ability.**	Charisma is	your Spellcasting	Ability for	your	Bard Spells.

**Spellcasting	Focus.**	You	can	use	a	Musical	Instrument `you are proficient in`  as	a	Spellcasting	Focus for	*your Bard Spells*{color:#D35400}.

**Prepared	Spells.**
Any Spell	you prepare	for	this	Class	must	be an Arcane Spell,	and it must	be from	one	of	the	following	Schools	of	Magic: Divination, Enchantment,	Illusion,	or	Transmutation.

Whenever	you	finish	a	Long	Rest *practicing	your	bardic	arts,	you can*{color:#D35400} replace	any	Spell	you	have	prepared	for	this	Class	with	another Arcane	Spell of	the	same	level,	abiding	by	the	school	restriction	above.

### College of Lore
Bards	of	the	College	of	Lore	know	something	about	most	things,	collecting	bits	of	knowledge	from	sources	as	diverse	as	scholarly	tomes	and	peasant	tales.	Whether	singing	folk	ballads	in	taverns	or	performing	elaborate	compositions	in	royal	courts,	these	Bards	use	their	gifts	to	hold	audiences	spellbound. 

The	college’s	members	gather	in	libraries	and	sometimes	in	actual	colleges,	complete	with	classrooms and	dormitories,	to	share	their	lore with	one	another.	They	also	meet	at	festivals	or affairs	of state,	where	they	can	expose	corruption,	unravel	lies,	and	poke	fun	at	self important	figures	of authority.

History,	and	Nature.	If	you	already	have	one	of

creature	that	you	can	see	within	60	feet	of	
yourself succeeds	on an	Ability	Check or	an	
Attack	Roll,	you	can	use	your	Reaction	to	expend	
one	of	your	uses	of	Bardic	Inspiration,	rolling	a

number	rolled	from	the	creature’s	roll,	
potentially	turning	it into	a	failure.

##### Cunning Inspiration
*Levels: 6th*

Through	your	studies	and	your	cunning,	you’ve	
learned to	inspire	others	exceptionally	well.	
When	any	creature	rolls	your	Bardic	Inspiration

the	higher	of	the	two	rolls.

##### Improved Cutting Words
*Levels: 10th*

# Ranger
This section details the ranger class.  

Far	from	the	bustle	of cities,	amid	the	trees	of	
trackless	forests	and	across	wide	plains,	Rangers	
keep	their	unending	watch.

Wanderers of	the	wilderness,	Rangers	
specialize	in	facing monsters	that	threaten	the	
world.	Rangers learn	to	track	their	quarry	as	a	
predator	does,	moving	stealthily	through	the	
wilds	and	hiding	themselves	in	brush	and	rubble.

Thanks	to	their	connection with	nature,	
Rangers	can	also	cast	Spells	that	harness	the	
primal powers	of	the	wilderness.	A	Ranger’s	
talents	and	magic are	honed	with	deadly	focus	
on	the	task	of	protecting	the	world	from the	
ravages	of	monsters	and	tyrants.

Mark,	you	know	whether	that	creature	has	any	
Immunities,	Resistances,	and	Vulnerabilities,	and	
if	the	creature	has	any,	you	know	what	they	are.

##### Multiattack
*Levels: 10th*

You	now	always	have	Conjure	Barrage prepared,	
and	it	doesn’t	count	against	the	number	of	Spells	
you	can	prepare.

You	can	also	cast	the	Spell	with	1st- and	2ndlevel	Spell	Slots.	When	you	do	so,	the	Spell’s
damage	is	reduced	by	1d8	for	each	slot	level	
below	3rd.

##### Superior Hunter's Defense
*Levels: 14th*

When	you	are hit by an	Attack	Roll,	you	can	use	
your	Reaction	to	halve	the	attack’s	damage	
against	yourself,	and	you	can	redirect	the	other	
half	of	the	damage to	one	creature (other	than	
the	attacker) that you	can	see	within	5	feet	of	
yourself.

# Rogue
This section details the rogue class.  

Far	from	the	bustle	of cities,	amid	the	trees	of	
trackless	forests	and	across	wide	plains,	Rangers	
keep	their	unending	watch.

Wanderers of	the	wilderness,	Rangers	
specialize	in	facing monsters	that	threaten	the	
world.	Rangers learn	to	track	their	quarry	as	a	
predator	does,	moving	stealthily	through	the	
wilds	and	hiding	themselves	in	brush	and	rubble.

Thanks	to	their	connection with	nature,	
Rangers	can	also	cast	Spells	that	harness	the	
primal powers	of	the	wilderness.	A	Ranger’s	
talents	and	magic are	honed	with	deadly	focus	
on	the	task	of	protecting	the	world	from the	
ravages	of	monsters	and	tyrants.

You	gain	Expertise in	two	of	your	Skill	Proficiencies	of	your	choice.

Sleight of Hand and Stealth	are	iconic	choices	for	a	Rogue	if	you	have	Proficiency	in	them.

### Sneak Attack
*Levels: 1st,* *every further odd level*{color:#D35400}

You	know	how	to	turn	a	subtle	attack	into	a	
deadly	one.	Once	on	each	of	your	turns	when you	
take	the	Attack	Action,	you	can	deal	extra	
damage	to	one	creature	you	hit	with	an	Attack	
Roll if	you’re	attacking	with	a	Finesse	Weapon	or	
a	Ranged	Weapon	and	if	at	least	one	of	the

and	add	the	dice	together	(the	Rogue	table	
shows	the	number	of	Sneak	Attack dice	you	get	
at	each	Rogue	level).	The	extra	damage’s	type	is	
the	same	as	the	weapon’s	Damage	Type

### Thieves' Cant
*Levels: 1st*

You picked	up	various	languages	in	the	
communities	where	you	plied	your roguish
talents.	You know	Thieves’ Cant	and	one other

Dash,	Disengage,	or Hide.

### Rogue Subclass and Features

{{pageNumber 14}}

When	an	attacker	that	you	can	see	hits	you	with	
an	Attack	Roll,	you	can	use	your	Reaction	to	
halve	the	attack’s	damage	against	you (round	
down).

### Evasion
*Levels: 9th*

You	can	nimbly	dodge	out	of	the	way	of	certain	
dangers.	When	you	are	subjected	to	an	effect	
that	allows	you	to	make	a	Dexterity	Saving	
Throw to	take	only	half	damage,	you	instead	take	
no	damage	if	you	succeed	on	the	Saving	Throw
and	only	half	damage	if	you	fail. You	can’t	use	
this	feature	if	you’re	Incapacitated.

### Reliable Talent
*Levels: 11th*

You have	refined	your	talents until	they	
approach	perfection.	Whenever	you	make	an	
Ability	Check that	uses	one	of	your	Skill	or	Tool	
Proficiencies,	you	can	treat	a	d20	roll	of	9	or	
lower	as	a	10.

### Subtle Strikes
*Levels: 13th*

When	you	attack,	you	know	how	to	exploit	a	
target’s distraction.	You	have	Advantage	on	any	
Attack	Roll that	targets	a	creature that	is	within	
5	feet	of	at	least	one	of	your	allies	who	isn’t	
Incapacitated.

### Slippery Mind
*Levels: 15th*

Your	cunning	mind	is	exceptionally	difficult	to	
control.	You	gain	Proficiency in Wisdom and
Charisma Saving	Throws.

### Elusive
*Levels: 17th*

You	are	so	evasive	that	attackers	rarely	gain	the	
upper	hand	against	you.	No	Attack	Roll has	
Advantage	against	you	while	you	aren’t	
Incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
*Levels: 18th*

You	have	an	uncanny	knack	for	succeeding	when	
you	need	to.	If	you	fail	a	d20	Test,	you	can	turn	
the	roll	into	a	20.

Once	you	use	this	feature,	you	can’t	use	it	again	
until	you	finish	a	Short	Rest	or	a	Long	Rest.

### Epic Boon
*Levels: 20th*

*You gain	an	Epic	Boon Feat	of your choice. (Recommended:	Epic Boon of Undetectability)*{color:#D35400}

## Rogue Subclasses 
A	Rogue Subclass	is	a	specialization	that	grants	you	special	abilities	at	certain	Rogue levels,	as	
specified	in	the	Subclass. 

*The iconic Rogue is a Thief.*{color:#D35400}

### Thief
You have honed your	larcenous	arts.	Burglars,	
bandits,	cutpurses,	and	other	criminals	typically	
adopt	this	Subclass,	but	so	do	Rogues	who	prefer	
to	think	of	themselves	as	treasure	seekers,	
explorers,	delvers,	and	investigators.

In	addition	to	improving	your	agility	and	
stealthiness,	you	gain abilities useful	for	delving	
into	ruins	and	getting	maximum	benefit	from the	
magic	items	you	find	there.

##### Fast Hands
*Levels: 3rd*

You	have	additional	options	for	the	Bonus	Action	
of	your	Cunning	Action,	with	which	you	can	do

##### Second-Story Work
*Levels: 3rd*

You	have	trained	to	reach	especially	hard-toreach	places,	granting	you	these	benefits:
**Climb	Speed.**:: You	gain	a	Climb	Speed equal	to	your	Speed.

(Stealth)	you	make,	provided	you	aren’t	wearing	
Medium	or	Heavy	Armor.

##### Use Magic Device
*Levels: 10th*

In	your	treasure	hunting,	you	have	learned	how	
to	maximize	use	of	magic	items,	granting	you	the	
following	benefits:
**Attunement.**:: You	can	attune	to	up	to	four	magic	items	at	once.
**Charges.**:: Whenever you	use	a	magic	item	property	that	expends	charges,	roll	a	d6.	On	a	roll	of	6,	you	use	the	property	without	expending	the	charges.
**Scrolls.**:: You	can	use	any Spell	Scroll that	bears	a	cantrip	or	a	1st-level	Spell. You	can	also	try	to	use	any Spell	Scroll that	contains	a	higher-level	Spell,	but	you	must	first	succeed	on	an	Intelligence	Check (Arcana)	with	a	DC	equal	to	10	+	the	Spell’s	level.	On	a	successful	check,	you	cast	the	Spell	from	the	scroll,	and	you	use	Intelligence	as	your	Spellcasting	Ability	for	this	casting. On	a	failed	check,	the	scroll	disintegrates.

##### Thief's Reflexes
*Levels: 14th*

You	can	now	take	a	second	Bonus	Action	on	your	
turn,	provided	it	is	the	Bonus	Action	from	
Cunning	Action.	You	can	use	this	feature	on	a	
number	of	turns	equal	to	your	Proficiency	
Bonus,	and	you	regain	all	expended	uses	when	
you	finish	a	Long	Rest.

# Races
This chapter details the playable races.
When	you	choose	your	character’s	Race,	you	
determine	whether	your	character	is	a	member	
of	the	human	race	or	of	a	fantastical	race. This	
*chapter*{color:#D35400}	provides	descriptions	and	rules	for	
the	following	Race options:	Human,	Ardling,	
Dragonborn,	Dwarf,	Elf,	Gnome,	Halfling,	Orc,	
and	Tiefling.
The	description	of	each	Race	includes	a	
section	of	game	traits,	which	your	character	
gains if	you	select	that Race.	NPCs	of	the	same	
ancestry	don’t	necessarily	have	the	same	traits,	
as	explained in	the	Monster	Manual;	the	traits	
here	pertain	to	player	characters.


##### Creature Type
All creatures in	D&D,	including	every	player	
character,	has	a	special	tag	in	the	rules	that	
identifies	the	type	of	creature	they	are. These	types	don’t	have	rules	themselves,	but	some	rules	in	the	game	affect creatures	of	certain	types	in	different	ways.	For	example,	the	
description of the Cure	Wounds Spell	specifies	the	healing doesn’t	work	on a	Construct.

Most	player	characters	are	of	the	Humanoid	type.
Here’s	a	list	of	the	game’s	Creature	Types	in	
alphabetical	order:

Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead

{{note
##### Children of different humanoid kinds
Thanks to the magical workings of the multiverse,
Humanoids of different kinds sometimes have
children together. For example, folk who have a
human parent and an orc or an elf parent are
particularly common. Many other combinations
are possible.
If you’d like to play the child of such a wondrous
pairing, choose two Race options that are
Humanoid to represent your parents. Then
determine which of those Race options provides
your game traits: Size, Speed, and special traits.
You can then mix and match visual
characteristics—color, ear shape, and the like—of
the two options. For example, if your character
has a halfling and a gnome parent, you might
choose Halfling for your game traits and then
decide that your character has the pointed ears
that are characteristic of a gnome.
Finally, determine the average of the two
options’ Life Span traits to figure out how long
your character might live. For example, a child of a
halfling and a gnome has an average life span of
288 years.

## Human
Found	throughout	the	multiverse,	humans	are	
as	varied	as	they	are	numerous.	They are	
relatively	short-lived,	but	they	strive	to	achieve	
as	much	as	they	can	in	the	years	they	are	given.	
They	are	skilled	pioneers and	artisans.	They	are	
builders	of nations,	roads,	cities,	and	ships.	They strive to	secure	their	place	in	the	world	and	in the	annals	of	history by	creating art,	amassing	
wealth,	making	laws,	and	questing	for	
immortality. Their	ambition and
resourcefulness are	commended,	respected,	and	
feared.

Humans are	as	diverse in	appearance	as	the	
people	of	Earth,	and	they	have	many	gods.
Scholars	dispute	the	origin	of	humanity,	but	one	
of	the	earliest	known	human	gatherings is	said	
to	have	occurred	in Sigil,	the	torus-shaped	city
at	the	center	of	the	multiverse	and	the	place	
where	the	Common	tongue	was	born. From	
there,	humans	could	have	spread	to	every	
corner	of	the	multiverse,	bringing	Sigil’s
cosmopolitanism with	them.
:::
#### Humans of many worlds
On	any	given	world	in	the	multiverse,	the
material	culture	of	humans	can	change	from	
one	region	to	another.	In	the	Forgotten	Realms,	
for	example,	the	clothing,	architecture,	cuisine,	
music,	and	literature	are	wildly	different	in	the	
Western	Heartlands	than	in	the	frozen	north	of	
Icewind	Dale.
As	humans	migrate,	they	bring	elements	of	
their	cultures with	them,	giving	rise	to	diverse	
settlements that	contain	people	with	different	
physical	characteristics,	not	to	mention	a	
medley	of	clothing	styles,	customs,	and	beliefs.

### Human Traits
Use the information below for your character sheet.

**Creature	Type:**	Humanoid

**Size:**	Medium	(about	4–7 feet	tall) or	Small	(about	2–4 feet	tall),	chosen	when	you	select	this	Race

**Speed:** 30	feet

**Life	Span:** 80 years	on	average

As	a	Human,	you	have	these	special	traits:

**Resourceful.** You	gain Heroic Inspiration whenever you finish	a	Long	Rest.

**Skillful.** You	gain	Proficiency	in	one Skill of	your	choice.

**Versatile.** You	gain a 1st-level	Feat of	your	choice.

## Dwarf
Resilient	like	the	mountains,	dwarves	were	
raised	up	from	the	earth	in	the	elder	days	by	a	
deity of	the	forge.	Called	by	various names	on	
different	worlds—Moradin,	Reorx,	and	others—
that	god gave dwarves	an	affinity	for stone	and	
metal and	for	living	underground.

Squat	and	often	bearded,	the	original	dwarves	
carved	cities	and	strongholds	into	
mountainsides	and	under	the	earth.	Their	
oldest	legends	tell	of	conflicts	with	the	monsters	
of	mountaintops	and	the	Underdark,	whether
those	monsters	were towering	giants or	
subterranean	horrors. Inspired	by those	tales,	
dwarves	of	any	culture	often	sing	of	valorous
deeds—especially	of the	little overcoming	the	
mighty.

#### Dwarves of many worlds
On	some	worlds in	the	multiverse,	the	first	
dwarven settlements	were	built	in	hills	or	
mountains,	and	the	dwarven	families who	trace	
their	ancestry	to	those	settlements	call	
themselves	hill	dwarves	or	mountain	dwarves,	
respectively. Oerth	and	Krynn	(the worlds	of the	Greyhawk	and	Dragonlance	settings,	
respectively) are	examples	of	worlds that	have	
such	dwarven	communities.
In	other	worlds,	dwarves have	given
themselves	other	cultural	designations.	For	
example,	on	the	continent	of	Faerûn	in the	
Forgotten	Realms,	the	dwarves	of	the	south	call
themselves	gold	dwarves,	and	the	dwarves	of	
the	north	are	shield	dwarves.

### Dwarf Traits
Use the information below for your character sheet.

**Creature	Type:**	Humanoid

**Size:**	Medium (about	4–5 feet tall)

**Speed:** 30	feet

**Life	Span:** 350	years on	average

**Darkvision.**	You	have	Darkvision with	a	range	of	60	feet.

**Dwarven	Resilience.** You	have	Resistance	to	Poison	Damage.	You	also	have	Advantage	on	saving	throws	you	make	to	avoid	or	end	the	Poisoned	Condition on	yourself.

**Dwarven	Toughness.** Your	Hit	Point	Maximum increases	by	1,	and	it	increases	by	1	again	whenever	you	gain	a	level.

**Forge Wise.** Your divine creator	gave	you	an	uncanny	affinity	for	working	with	stone	or	
metal. You	gain	Tool	Proficiency with	two of	the	following	options	of	your	choice:	Jeweler’s	Tools,	Mason’s	Tools,	Smith’s	Tools,	or	Tinker’s	Tools.

**Stonecunning.** As	a	Bonus	Action,	you	gain	Tremorsense* with	a	range	of	60 feet for	10 minutes. You	must	be	on	a	stone	surface	or	touching	such	a	surface to	use	this	Tremorsense. The	stone	can	be	natural	or	worked. You	can	use	this	Bonus	Action	a	number	of	times	equal	to	your	Proficiency	Bonus, and	you	regain all	expended	uses	when	you	finish	a	Long	Rest.


## Elf
Created	by	the	god	Corellon,	the	first	elves	
could	change	their	physical	forms	at	will.	The	
elves lost	this	ability	when	Corellon	exiled	them	
from	Arvandor	for	plotting	with	another	elven	
deity	named	Lolth,	who	tried	and	failed	to	usurp	
Corellon’s	dominion.	When	Lolth	was	cast	down	
into	the	Abyss,	most	elves	renounced	her	
treachery and	earned	Corellon’s	forgiveness,	
but	that	which	Corellon	had	taken	from	the	
elves	was	lost	forever.

No	longer	able	to	shape-shift	at	will,	the	elves	
retreated	to	the	Feywild,	where	their	sorrow	
was	deepened	by	that	plane’s	influence.	Over	
time,	wanderlust	and	curiosity	led	many	of	
them	to	explore	other	planes	of	existence,	
including	various	worlds	in	the	Material	Plane.

Elves	have the	mystical	ability	to	take	on	
characteristics	of	the	environments	with	which	
they	are	bonded—drow	to	the	Underdark,	high	
elves	to	fey	crossings	in	the	Material	Plane,	and	
wood	elves	to	forests.	These	connections	grant	
elves	access	to	certain	kinds	of	magic.

Elves	are	blessed	with	long	lives	and	long	
memories.	From	birth,	they	don’t	sleep	but	
instead	enter	a	trance	when	they	need	to	rest.	In	
this	state,	elves	remain	aware	of	their	
surroundings	while	immersing	themselves	in	
their	own	memories.	What	an	elf	remembers	
during	this	reverie	depends	largely	on	how	long the	elf	has	lived	and	the	events	that	have	
shaped	the	elf’s	existence.

Elves	have	pointed	ears	and	tend	to	be	light	
on	their	feet.	Another	common	physical	
characteristic	of elves	is	their lack	of	facial	and
body	hair.

#### Elves of many worlds
After	leaving	the	Feywild,	elves	established	
deep	roots	on	worlds	throughout the	
multiverse. Within	their	respective	domains,	
elves	often	use	their	magic	and	other resources	
to	build	fabulous	enclaves.	The	subterranean	
cities	and	outposts of	the	drow,	the	gleaming	
towers	and	citadels	of	the	high	elves,	and	the	
forest	sanctuaries of	the	wood	elves	are	nothing	
short	of	architectural	wonders,	which reflect	
their	builders’ otherworldly	origins.

**Drow.** Known	for	their	white	hair	and	duskygray skin	tones, drow	typically	dwell	in	the
Underdark.	Noteworthy	exceptions	include
Drizzt	Do’Urden and	Jarlaxle	Baenre,	two drow	
adventurers of	the	Forgotten	Realms who	shun
their subterranean	homeland.	Some	drow	
societies	avoid	the	Underdark	altogether.	On
the	world of	Eberron,	for	example,	drow dwell	
in gloomy	rainforests	and	cyclopean	ruins	on	
the	continent	of	Xen’drik.



**High	Elves.** On	some	worlds,	high	elves refer	
to	themselves	by	other	names.	For	example,	the	
sun	elves	and	moon	elves	of Toril	(the	world	of	
the	Forgotten	Realms setting) are	high	elves,	as	
are	the Silvanesti and	Qualinesti of Krynn	(the	
world	of	Dragonlance) and	the	Aereni	of	
Eberron.

**Wood	Elves.** Wood	elves	are	known	across	
the	multiverse	by	many	other	names,	including
wild	elves,	green	elves,	and forest	elves.	
Grugach	are	reclusive	wood	elves	on	Oerth	(the	
world	of	the	Greyhawk	setting),	while	the	
Kagonesti	and	the	Tairnadal	are	wood	elves	of	
Krynn	and	Eberron,	respectively

## Gnome
Gnomes	are	magical	folk created	by	gods	of
hard	work,	invention,	trickery,	and	life	
underground.	The	earliest gnomes were	seldom	
seen	by	other	folk	due	to	the	gnomes’ secretive	
nature	and	their	propensity	for	lairing	in sylvan
forests,	hillside burrows, and	sprawling
warrens under	mountains. What	they	lacked	in	
size,	they	made	up	for	in	cleverness	and	
cunning. They	confounded	predators with	
elaborate traps	and	low,	narrow,	labyrinthine	
tunnels.	They	also	learned	useful magic	from gods like	Garl	Glittergold,	Baervan	
Wildwanderer, and	Baravar	Cloakshadow,	who	
often	lived	among	them (usually in	disguise).

Gnomes	are	petite	folk with	big	eyes,	pointed	
ears,	and	wistful	imaginations.	Harkening	back	
to	a	time	when	their	ancestors	hid	in	tunnels	
and	under	thick	forest	canopies,	many	gnomes
like	the	feeling	of	a	roof	over	their	head,	even	if	
that	“roof”	is	nothing	more	than	a	hat.

#### Gnomes of many worlds
Gnomes	past	and	present	are	known	to equate	
secrecy	with	safety,	which	is	why	gnome	
settlements	are	often	tucked	away or	concealed	
by	magical	illusions.

**Forest	Gnomes.** Gnomes	who	have	ancestral	
ties	to forests	are	called	forest	gnomes.	They	
use	their	magic	to	befriend small	forest	animals	
and	rely	on	them	for	news	concerning	their	
neighbors—be	they	malevolent or	benign.

**Rock Gnomes.** Gnomes whose ancestors	
dwelled	under	mountains	are	called	rock	
gnomes. On	some	worlds,	including	Krynn	(the	
world	of	the	Dragonlance	setting),	rock	gnomes
are	also	known	as	tinker	gnomes	due	to	their	
fondness	for artifice	and	clockwork	inventions.

## Halfling
Cherished	and	guided	by	gods	who	value	life,	
home,	and	hearth,	halflings	gravitate	toward	
bucolic	havens	where	family	and	community	
help	shape	their	lives.	That	said,	many	halflings	
are	blessed	(some	might	say	cursed)	with	a	
brave	and	adventurous	spirit	that	leads	them	on	
journeys	of	discovery,	affording	them	the	
chance	to	explore	a	bigger	world	and	make	new	
friends	along	the	way.	Their	size—being	not	
unlike	that	of	a	human	child—helps	them	avoid	
unwanted	entanglements and	slip	into	and	out	
of	tight	spaces.

Anyone	who	has	spent	time	around	halflings,	
and	particularly	halfling	adventurers,	has	likely	
witnessed	the	storied	“luck	of	the	halflings”	in	
action.	When	a	halfling	is	in	mortal	danger,	it	
seems	as	though an	unseen	force	intervenes	on	
the	halfling’s	behalf.	Many	halflings	believe	in	
the	power	of	luck,	and	they	attribute	their	
unusual	gift	to	one	or	more	of	their	benevolent	
gods,	including	Yondalla,	Brandobaris,	and	
Charmalaine.

#### Halflings of many worlds
On	many	worlds,	halflings	are	walking,	talking	
contradictions:	home,	tradition,	and	pastoral	
pursuits	collide	with	a	gods-given love of	
adventure	and	a	knack	for	getting	into	and	out	
of	trouble. Halfling	communities	come	in	all	
varieties. For	every	sequestered	halfling	shire	
tucked	away	in	some	unspoiled	corner	of	the	
world,	there’s	a	halfling	crime	syndicate like	the	Boromar	Clan	on the	world	of	Eberron or	a
territorial	mob of	halflings like	those	found	on
the	world	of	Athas.

Some	halfling settlers, particularly	ones	who	
prefer to	live	underground, are	thought to	have	
a	little	bit of	dwarven	blood	coursing	through	
their	veins	and	are	sometimes	called
strongheart	halflings	or	stouts. Nomadic	
halflings, as	well	as	those	who	live among	
humans	and	other	tall folk, are	sometimes	
called	lightfoot	halflings	or	tallfellows.

### Halfling Traits
Use the information below for your character sheet.

**Creature	Type:**	Humanoid

**Size:**	Small	(about	2–3	feet	tall)

**Speed:** 30	feet

**Life	Span:** 150	years	on	average

**Brave.** You	have	Advantage	on	saving	throws	you	make	to	avoid	or	end	the	Frightened Condition on	yourself.

**Halfling	Nimbleness.** You	can	move	through	the	space	of	any	creature	that	is	of	a	Size	larger	
than	yours,	but	you	can’t	stop	there.

**Luck.** When	you	roll	a	1	on the	d20 of a	d20	Test, you	can	reroll	the	die, and you must	use	
the	new	roll.

**Naturally	Stealthy.** You	have	Proficiency	in	the	Stealth	Skill.

## Orc
Orcs	trace	their	creation	to	Gruumsh,	the	OneEyed	God,	an	unstoppable	warrior	and	powerful	
leader.	Gruumsh	armed	his children	with	
certain	gifts	to	help	them thrive	on worlds	beset	
by	monsters. Even	when	they	turn	their	
devotion	to	other	gods,	orcs	retain the gifts	that
the	One-Eyed	God	bestowed	upon	them:	might,	
endurance,	determination,	and	the	ability	to	see	
in	the	dark.

Orcs	are,	on	average, tall and	broad.	They	
have gray	skin,	ears	that	are	small	and	slightly	
pointed, and	prominent	lower	canines that	
resemble	small	tusks. Young	orcs	are	often	told	
about their	ancestors’ ancient conflicts	with	
elves	in	forests,	dwarves	under	mountains,	and	
invaders from	evil planes	of	existence.	Inspired	
by	those	tales,	young	orcs often wonder	when
Gruumsh	will	call	on them	to	match	the	heroic	
deeds	of	their	ancestors,	and	if	they	will	prove	
worthy	of	the	One-Eyed	God’s	grace.

#### Orcs of many worlds
On	many worlds,	orcs	occupy	territory claimed	
by	their	ancestors.	Their	settlements	and	
strongholds can	be	found	almost	anywhere,	
above	ground	and	below.

Orcs	sometimes flock	to	the	banners	of	
powerful	monarchs.	King	Obould	Many-Arrows	
of	Toril	(the	world	of	the Forgotten	Realms	
setting)	is	one	such	figure,	his	strength	
tempered	by	a	willingness	to	make	peace	with	
his	enemies.

On	worlds	such	as	Eberron,	orcs	were	among	
those	who	defended the	natural	order	from	the	
encroachments	of	Fiends	and	other	extraplanar	
threats.	Their	descendants learned	to live	in	
harmony	with	their	neighbors	and	the	natural	
world,	and to	many	of them,	Gruumsh’s	wars	
are	distant	memories.

### Orc Traits
Use the information below for your character sheet.

**Creature	Type:**	Humanoid

**Size:**	Medium	(about 6–7 feet	tall)

**Speed:** 30	feet

**Life	Span:** 80	years	on	average

**Adrenaline	Rush.**	You	can	take	the	Dash	Action	as	a	Bonus	Action. When	you	do	so,	you	
gain	a	number	of	Temporary	Hit	Points	equal	to	 your	Proficiency	Bonus. You	can	use	this	trait	a	number	of	times	equal	to	your	Proficiency	Bonus,	and	you	regain	all	expended	uses	when	you	finish a	Long	Rest.

**Darkvision.** You	have	Darkvision	with	a	range	of	60	feet.

**Powerful	Build.** You	count	as	one	Size	larger	when	determining	your	carrying	capacity	and	the	weight	you	can	push,	drag,	or	lift.

**Relentless	Endurance.** When	you	are	reduced	to	0	Hit Points	but	not	killed	outright,	you	can	drop	to	1	Hit	Point	instead.	Once	you	use	this	trait,	you	can’t	do	so	again	until	you	finish	a	Long	Rest.

## Ardling
Ardlings	are	supernal	beings	who	are	either	
born	on	the	Upper	Planes	or	have	one	or	more	
ancestors	who originated	there. Their	bright	
souls	shine with	the	light	of	immortal	beings
who	call	the	Upper	Planes	home.

An ardling has	a	head resembling	that of	an
animal,	typically one with virtuous	associations.
Depending	on	the	animal,	the	ardling	might	also	
have	soft	fur,	downy	feathers,	or	supple	bare	
skin.	The	ardling’s	celestial	legacy determines	
the	animal	it	resembles.

An ardling gains	a	measure	of	magical	power	
from	their	celestial	legacy,	as	well	as the	ability	
to	manifest spectral wings.	An	ardling’s moral	
and	ethical	outlook	is self-determined,	however,	
not	fixed by	ancestry.

The	three	celestial	legacies	are	as	follows:
**Exalted.**:: The	fierce passions	of	Arborea,	the	 heroic	heart	of	Ysgard,	and	the wondrous	nature of	the Beastlands call	to	ardlings who	have	the	Exalted celestial legacy.	Their	celestial	ancestors	are heroic	champions	of	the	Chaotic	Good	planes.
**Heavenly.**::	The	blissful harmony	of	Arcadia,	the	unwavering justice of	Mount	Celestia,	and	the	bucolic paradise	of	Bytopia touch the	souls	of ardlings	who	have	the	Heavenly	celestial	legacy.	Their	celestial	ancestors	are	staunch	defenders	of	the	Lawful	Good	planes.
**Idyllic.**:: The	Idyllic celestial legacy	connects	ardlings not	only	to	the	Beastlands and Bytopia but	also	to	the	eternal	compassion	of	Elysium.	Their	celestial	ancestors	are	paragons	of	kindness who	hail from the	Neutral	Good	planes.

#### Ardlings of Many Worlds
Ardlings	bring	a	little	bit	of	the	Upper	Planes	
with	them	wherever	they	go.	On	many	worlds,	
the	first	ardlings used the	magic	of	their	
celestial	legacies	to	inspire and	heal	others.

By	virtue	of	their	celestial	legacies,	some	
ardlings	strive	to	make	the	world	a	better	place.	
Others	use	their	supernal	gifts	to	be	the	best	
version	of	themselves	they	can	be.	Still	others	
are	delighted	to	have	a	connection	to	the	Upper	
Planes	without	the	responsibility	of	always	
having	to	do	the	right	thing.

### Ardling Traits
Use the information below for your character sheet.

**Creature	Type:**	Humanoid

**Size:**	Medium	(about	4–7	feet	tall)	or	Small (about	3–4 feet	tall),	chosen	when	you	select	this	Race

**Speed:** 30	feet

**Life	Span:** 200 years	on	average

**Angelic	Flight.** As	a	Bonus	Action,	you sprout	spectral	wings	for	a	moment	and fly	up	to	a	number	of	feet	equal	to	your	Speed.	If	you	are	in	the	air	at	the	end	of	this	movement,	you	fall if	nothing	is	holding	you	aloft. You	can	use	this	Bonus	Action	a	number	of	times	equal	to	your	Proficiency	Bonus,	and	you	 regain	all	expended	uses	when	you	finish	a	Long	Rest.

**Celestial	Legacy.** You	are	the	recipient	of	a	celestial legacy	that	grants	you	magical abilities. Choose	a legacy from	the	Celestial Legacies table:	Exalted,	associated	with	Chaotic	Good planes; Heavenly,	associated	with	Lawful	Good planes;	or	Idyllic,	associated	with	Neutral Good planes. You	gain	the	initial benefit	of	the	chosen	legacy:	a	cantrip	that	you	learn. You also choose	the	animal	you	most	closely	resemble;	the	table	 provides	a	few suggestions	for	each	legacy (you don’t	gain wings	by	choosing	an	animal	that	can	fly). 

Starting	at	3rd	level	and	again	at	5th	level, you	gain	the	ability	to	cast	a	higher-level	Spell with	this	trait,	as	shown	on	the	table.	Once	you	 cast	the	Spell with	this	trait,	you	can’t	cas that	Spell with	it	again	until	you	finish	a	Long	Rest;	however,	you	can	cast	the	Spell using	any	Spell Slots	you	have	of	the	appropriate	level. 

Intelligence,	Wisdom,	or	Charisma	is	your	spellcasting	ability	for	the	Spells	you	cast	with	
this	trait	(choose	the	ability	when	you	select	the	legacy).

**Damage	Resistance.** You	have	Resistance	to	 Radiant	Damage.

## Dragonborn
The	earliest dragonborn	hatched	from	the	eggs	
of	chromatic	and	metallic	dragons. One	story	
holds	that these	eggs	were	blessed	by	the
dragon	gods	Bahamut	and	Tiamat,	who	wanted
to populate	the	worlds	of	dragons with	people	
created	in	their	image.	Another	story holds	that	
dragons created	the	first	dragonborn without	
the	gods’ blessings.	Whatever	their	origin,	
dragonborn	have	made	homes	for	themselves	
on	the	worlds	of	the	Material	Plane.

Dragonborn	look	like	wingless,	bipedal
dragons—scaly,	bright-eyed, and	thick-boned,	
with	horns	on	their	heads. Dragonborn	of	
chromatic	ancestry	have	scales	that	are	black,	
blue,	green,	red,	or	white,	whereas	dragonborn	
of	metallic	ancestry	have	scales	that	are	the	
color	of	brass,	bronze,	copper,	gold,	or	silver.	
When	two	dragonborn	whose	scales	are	of	
different	colors produce	a	child,	their offspring’s	
scales	match	those of	one parent or	the	other.

Like	their	draconic	ancestors,	dragonborn	can	
exhale	acid,	cold,	fire,	lightning,	or	poison. One	
can	tell	the	type	of	energy	a	dragonborn	
breathes	by	the	color	of	the	dragonborn’s
scales.

#### Dragonborn of many worlds
Like	dragons,	dragonborn	have	a	mystical	bond	
to	the	Material	Plane and	are	spread	across	its	
many	worlds.

On	some	worlds,	the	earliest	dragonborn	
settlements	were	built	near	dragon	lairs	so	that	
the	dragonborn	could	pay	tribute	to	their	
draconic	progenitors.	Many	of these	ancient	
settlements still	exist. For	example,	the	dragonruled	continent of	Argonnessen (on	the	world	of	
Eberron)	has dragonborn cities tucked	among
its	mountain	ranges.

On other	worlds,	dragonborn	ply	their	skills	
in	settlements	populated	mostly	by	nondragonborn,


fulfilling	an	urge	to	expand	their	
presence and	influence,	much	as	dragons do.

## Tiefling
Tieflings	are	either	born	in	the	Lower	Planes	or	
have	one	or	more	fiendish	ancestors who	
originated	there.	A tiefling (pronounced	TEEFling) is	linked	by	blood	to	a	devil,	a	demon,	a	
yugoloth,	or	some	other	Fiend. This	connection	
to	the	Lower	Planes	is,	for	better	or	worse,	the	
tiefling’s fiendish	legacy,	which	comes	with	the	
promise	of	power	yet	has no	effect	on	the	
tiefling’s	moral	outlook.

A	tiefling	chooses whether	to	embrace	or	
lament their fiendish	legacy.	The	three	legacies	
are	as	follows:

**Abyssal.**:: The	heartless	entropy	of	the	Abyss,	the	howling	chaos	of	Pandemonium,	and	the	vast	despair	of	Carceri	call	to	tieflings	who	have the	Abyssal	fiendish	legacy.	Horns,	fur,	tusks,	black	blood,	and	peculiar odors are	common	physical	features	of	such tieflings,	most of	whom have	the	blood	of	demons	coursing	through their	veins.

**Chthonic.**::	Tieflings	who	have	the	Chthonic	fiendish	legacy not	only	feel	the	tug	of	Carceri	but	also	the	greed	of	Gehenna	and	the	underworld	gloom of	Hades.	Some	of	these tieflings	look cadaverous.	Others possess the	unearthly	beauty	of	an incubus or a	succubus, or	they have	physical	features	in	common	with a	night	hag,	a	yugoloth, or	some	other	Neutral	Evil	fiendish	ancestor.

**Infernal.**:: The	Infernal	fiendish	legacy binds tieflings	by	blood	not	only	to	Gehenna	but	also	the	raging	battlefields of	Acheron	and	the	diabolical	Nine	Hells. Horns,	spines,	tails,	golden	eyes,	and	a faint	odor of	sulfur	or	smoke	are	common	physical	features of	such	tieflings,	most of	whom	trace	their	ancestry	to	devils.

#### Tieflings of many worlds
Tieflings	born	in the	Lower	Planes often
migrate	to	other	planes	of	existence and	never	
look	back. Their descendants	are	scattered	
across	many	worlds and	are	especially	
prevalent	in	Sigil,	the	torus-shaped	city	at	the	
center	of	the	multiverse.

The earliest tieflings	joined	ranks	with nontieflings to	repel fiendish	incursions on	many	
worlds,	earning	the	trust	of	those who	might	
otherwise	have	mistaken	them	for	Fiends.
Thanks	to	the victories	and sacrifices of	these	
legends,	tieflings	throughout	the	multiverse
enjoy widespread acceptance.

### Tiefling Traits
Use the information below for your character sheet.

**Creature	Type:** Humanoid

**Size:**	Medium	(about	4–7	feet	tall)	or	Small	(about	3–4	feet	tall) ,	chosen	when	you	select	
this	Race

**Speed:** 30	feet

**Life	Span:** 100 years	on	average

**Darkvision.**	You	have	Darkvision	with	a	range	of	60	feet.

**Fiendish	Legacy.** You	are	the	recipient	of	a	
fiendish	legacy that	grants	you supernatural	
abilities.	Choose	a legacy from	the	Fiendish
Legacies table:	Abyssal,	associated	with	Chaotic	
Evil	planes;	Chthonic,	associated	with	Neutral	
Evil	planes;	or Infernal,	associated	with	Lawful	
Evil	planes.	You	gain	the	1st-level	benefit	of	the	
chosen	legacy.

Starting	at	3rd	level	and	again	at	5th	level,	
you	gain	the	ability	to	cast	a	higher-level Spell
with	this	trait,	as	shown	on	the	table.	Once	you	
cast	the	Spell with	this	trait,	you	can’t	cast	that	
Spell with	it	again	until	you	finish	a	Long	Rest.

# Backgrounds
This chapter details backgrounds.

Your	character’s	Background	is	a	collection	of	
characteristics	that	represent	the	place	and	
occupation	that	were	most	formative	for	the	
character	before	they	embarked	on	a	life	of	
adventure.
When	you	choose	a	Background,	you	have	
three	options:

• Build	a	Background	by	using	the	rules	in	the	
“Build	Your	Background”	section.	

• Select	a	premade Background	from	the	
“Sample	Backgrounds”	section.

• Select	a	premade	Background	from	the	
“Sample	Backgrounds”	section	and	then customize	it	with	the	rules	in	the	“Build	Your	
Background”	section.

<br>

No	matter	which	Background	you	choose,	
consider	these	questions	from	your	character’s	
viewpoint:

• How	does	your	Background	influence	your	
current	worldview?

• Do	you	embrace	or	reject	your	Background?

• Did	you	form	any	relationships	during your	Background	that	endure	today?

## Build Your Background
Using	the	rules	here,	you	can	build	a	
Background	from	scratch or	customize	a	
premade	Background,	focusing	on	details	
related	to	the	backstory	you	have	in	mind	for	
your	character.

When	you build	a	Background,	your	character
gains the	features in	the	“Background	Features”
section below. As	you	make	choices	for	those	
features,	think	about	your	character’s	past.	
Where	did	they	spend	most	of	their	time?	What	
did	they	do	for	a	living?	What	capabilities	and	
possessions	did	they	acquire?	What	language	
did	they	learn	from	their	family,	associates,	or	
studies? How	did	their	past	affect	their	ability	
scores?

If	you	instead	decide	to	customize	a	premade
Background,	you	can	choose	any	features	in	that	
Background	and	replace	them	with	the	features	
below	of	the	same	name.	For	example,	if	you	
want	to	change	a	Background’s	Language	
feature,	you	can	replace	that	feature	with	the	
Language	feature	below.

### Background Features

**Ability Scores.**:: When you determine your character’s ability scores, choose two of them, and increase one by 2 and the other one by 1. Alternatively, choose three ability scores, and increase each of them by 1.
**Skill Proficiencies.**:: Choose two Skills. Your character gains Proficiency in them.
**Tool Proficiency.**:: Choose one tool. Your character gains Tool Proficiency with it.
**Language.**:: *Your	character	begins	play	knowing	at	least	three	languages: Common, one language from the Standard Languages Table, and one language from either Language table below.*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat.**:: Choose one 1st-level Feat. Your character gains that Feat.
**Equipment.**:: Your character gains 50 GP to spend on starting equipment. The character keeps any unspent GP as spare coin.

#### Languages
Knowledge	of	a	language	means	 your	character	can	communicate	in	that	
language	and	can	read	and	write	it.

The	Standard	Languages	table	lists	languages	
that	are	widespread	on	D&D	worlds in	the	
Material	Plane,	and	the	Rare	Languages	table	
lists languages	that	are	more	rarely	known on	
those	worlds.	In	each	table,	typical	users of	a	
language	are	mentioned.

##### Standard Languages
| Language      | Typical User |
|:--------------|:-------------|
| Common | Anyone |
| Common Sign Language | Anyone |
| Dwarvish | Dwarves |
|Elvish | Elves |
|Giant | Giants |
|Gnomish | Gnomes |
|Goblin | Goblinoids |
|Halfling | Halflings |
|Orc | Orcs |


##### Rare Languages
| Language      | Typical User |
|:--------------|:-------------|
|Abyssal | Demons |
|Celestial | Celestials |
|Deep Speech | Aberrations |
|Draconic | Dragons |
|Druidic | Druids |
|Infernal | Devils |
|Primordial (includes the <br> Aquan, Auran, Ignan,<br>and Terran dialects) | Elementals |
|Sylvan | Fey |
|Thieves’ Cant | Rogues |
|Undercommon | Underdark folk |

{{note
#### Ability Score Increases from elsewhere
Since 2014, characters have received ability score
increases from several sources, either from a Race
that has the Ability Score Increase trait or from
the ability score rules in Tasha’s Cauldron of
Everything, Monsters of the Multiverse, and other
books. If you make a character using one of those
older sources and get ability score increases from
it, the character doesn’t also get ability score
increases from Background, unless you forgo the
older ability score increases to gain the increases
from the Background rules here.

## Sample Backgrounds
Here	is	a	collection	of	sample	Backgrounds	that	
you	can	choose	from	when	making	a	character.
These	Backgrounds	were	built	using	the	rules	in	
the	“Build	Your	Background”	section,	and	each	
of	them	contains	story-oriented	details that	are	
meant	inspire	you	as	you	think	of	your	
character’s	backstory.


#### Acolyte
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Wisdom, +1 Intelligence
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Insight, Religion

You	devoted	yourself	to	service	in	a	temple,	
either	nestled	in	a	town	or	secluded	in	a	sacred	
grove.	There	you	performed	hallowed	rites	in	
honor	of	a	god	or	pantheon.	You	served	under	a	
priest and	studied	religion.	Thanks	to	your	
priest’s	instruction	and	your	own	devotion,	you	
also	learned	how	to	channel	a	modicum	of	
divine	power	in	service	to	your	place	of	worship	
and	the	people	who	prayed	there.


#### Artisan
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Intelligence, +1 Charisma
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Investigation, Persuasion
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Artisan’s Tools (one of your choice)
**Languages:**:: *Common, Gnomish, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Crafter
**Equipment:**:: Abacus, Artisan’s Tools (same as above), Merchant’s Scale, Pouch (2), Traveler’s Clothes, 25 GP
You began	mopping	floors	and	scrubbing	
counters	in	an	artisan’s	workshop	for	a	few	
coppers	per	day	as	soon	as	you	were	strong
enough	to	carry	a	bucket.	When	you	were	
finally	old	enough	to	apprentice,	you	learned	to	
create	basic	crafts	of	your	own,	as	well	as	how	
to	sweet-talk	the	occasional	demanding	
customer.	As	part	of	your	studies,	you	picked	up	
Gnomish,	the	tongue	from	which	so	many	of	the	
artisan’s	terms	of	art	are	derived.	

#### Charlatan
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Charisma, +1 Dexterity
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Deception, Sleight of Hand
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Forgery Kit
**Language:**::*Common,  Infernal, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Skilled

Soon	after	you	were	old	enough	to	order	an	ale,	
you	already	had	a	favorite	stool	in	every	tavern	
within	ten	miles	of	where	you	were	born.	As	
you	traveled	the	circuit	from	public	house	to	
watering	hole,	you	learned	to	prey	on	the	
unfortunates	who	were	in	the	market	for	a	
comforting	lie	or	two—perhaps	a	sham	potion	
or	a	forged	“treasure	map.”	You	are	fluent	in	
Infernal,	the	ancient	language	of	deception.

#### Criminal
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Dexterity, +1 Intelligence
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Sleight of Hand, Stealth
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Thieves’ Tools
**Languages:**:: *Common, Thieves’ Cant, any standard language*{color:#D35400}

**Equipment:**:: Crowbar, Dagger (2), Pouch (2), Thieves’ Tools, Traveler’s Clothes, 16 GP
You learned	to	earn	your	coin	in	dark	alleyways,	
cutting	purses	or	burgling	shops.	Perhaps	you	
were	part	of	a	small	gang	of	like-minded	
wrongdoers,	who	looked	out	for	each	other.	Or	
maybe	you	were	a	lone	wolf,	fending	for	
yourself	against	the	local	thieves’ guild	and	
older,	more	fearsome	lawbreakers.

#### Cultist
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Intelligence, +1 Charisma
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Arcana, Religion
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Disguise Kit
**Language:**:: *Common, Abyssal, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Magic Initiate (Arcane)
**Equipment:**:: Bell, Common Clothes, Dagger, Disguise Kit, Lamp, Robe, 19 GP
You	scarcely	recall	what	drove	you	into	the	
service	of	the	otherworldly	being.	Those	
memories	were	blotted	out	long	ago	by	
recurrent	dreams	of	midnight	gatherings	round	
the	obsidian	pillar	in	the	glade.	By	the	light	of	
each	waning	moon,	the	hierophants	instructed	
you	in	the	being’s	creed and	the	rudiments	of	
the	arcane	arts.	When	you	came	of	age,	you	
were	ordered	to	blend	in	among	the	
nonbelievers	and	await	whatever	mission	the	
Great	One has in	store	for	you.

#### Entertainer
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Charisma, +1 Dexterity
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Acrobatics, Performance
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Musical Instrument (one of your choice)
**Language:**:: *Common, Elvish, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Musician
**Equipment:**:: Costume (2), Musical Instrument (same as above), Perfume, Steel Mirror, Traveler’s Clothes, 8 GP
You	spent	much	of	your	youth	following	roving	
fairs	and	carnivals,	performing	odd	jobs	for	
musicians	and	acrobats	in	exchange	for	lessons.	You	may	have	learned	how	to	walk	a	tightrope,	
how	to	double	pick	a	lute,	or	how	to	recite	
Elvish	poetry	with	the	impeccable	trills	of	an	elf
poet.	To	this	day,	you	thrive	on	applause	and	
long	for	the	stage.

#### Farmer
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Constitution, +1 Wisdom
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Animal Handling, Nature
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Carpenter’s Tools
**Languages:**:: *Common, Halfling, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Tough
**Equipment:**:: Carpenter’s Tools, Healer’s Kit, Iron Pot, Shovel, Sickle, Traveler’s Clothes, 23 GP
You	grew	up	close	to	the	land.	Years	tending	
animals and	cultivating	the	earth	rewarded	you	
with	patience	and	good	health.	You	have	a	keen	
appreciation	for	nature’s	bounty	alongside	a	
healthy	respect	for	nature’s	wrath.	Like	many	
farmers,	you	made	frequent	use	of	the	
agricultural	almanacs	produced	by	the	greatest	
halfling	farmers.

#### Gladiator
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Strength, +1 Charisma
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Athletics, Performance
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Smith’s Tools
**Language:**:: *Common, Orc, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Savage Attacker
**Equipment:**:: Chain, Costume, Healer’s Kit, Javelin (6), Smith’s Tools, Traveler’s Clothes, 15 GP
Your	first	few	appearances	in	the	gladiatorial	
pits	led	you	to	appreciate	every	one	of	the	scars	
you	carry	from	your instructors	and	sparring	
partners.	Each	scar was	a	lesson	that	taught	you	
how	to	best	your	opponents	and	curry	favor	
with	the	crowds	your	brawls	entertained.	Your	
time	in	the	pits	left	you	with	a	strong	hand	and	
a	strong	heart.	You’ll	forever	share	a	
remarkable	bond	with	the	other	pit	fighters	in	
your	stable—humans,	dragonborn,	dwarves,	
and	orcs—hardened	warriors	all.


#### Guard
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Strength, +1 Wisdom
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Athletics, Perception
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Gaming Set (one of your choice)

**Feat:**:: Alert
**Equipment:**:: Crossbow Bolt (20), Gaming Set (same as above), Hooded Lantern, Light Crossbow, Manacles, Quiver, Spear, Traveler’s Clothes, 12 GP
Your	feet begin	to ache	when	you	remember	the	
countless	hours	you	spent	at	your	post	in	the	
tower.	You	were	trained	to	keep	one	eye	
outside	the	wall,	watching	for	marauders	
sweeping	from the	nearby	forest,	and	your	
other	eye	inside	the	wall,	searching	for	
cutpurses	and	troublemakers.	At	the	end	of
each	shift,	you	bunked	in	the	mayor’s	barracks	
alongside	your	fellow	sentries	and	the	dwarven	
smiths	who	kept	your	armor	snug	and	your	
weapons	sharp.

#### Guide

**Feat:**:: Magic Initiate (Primal)
**Equipment:**:: Arrow (20), Bedroll, Cartographer’s Tools, Fishing Tackle, Quiver, Shortbow, Tent, Traveler’s Clothes, 2 GP
You	came	of	age	in	the	outdoors,	far	from	
settled	lands.	Your	home?	Anywhere	you	chose	
to	unfurl	your	bedroll.	There	are	wonders	on	
the	frontier—strange	monsters,	pristine	forests	
and	streams,	overgrown	ruins	of	great	halls	
once	trod	by	giants—and	you	learned	to	fend	
for	yourself	as	you	explored	them.	From	time	to	
time,	you	traveled	with	a	pair	of	friendly	druids	
who	were	kind	enough	to	instruct	you	in	the	
fundamentals	of	channeling	the	magic	of	the	
wild.	

#### Hermit
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Wisdom, +1 Constitution

You	spent	your	early	years	secluded	in	a	hut or	
monastery	located	well	beyond	the	outskirts	of	
the	nearest	settlement.	In	those	days,	your	only	
companions	were	the	creatures	of	the	forest,	
who	would	occasionally	visit	to	bring	news	of	
the	outside	world	and	supplies. The quiet and	
solitude you	found	in	your	time	outside society	
allowed	you	to	spend	many	hours	pondering	
the	mysteries	of	creation,	attuning	your	mind	to	
the	magical	energy	flowing	through	the	natural	
world.

#### Laborer
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Constitution, +1 Strength
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Athletics, Survival
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Mason’s Tools

**Feat:**:: Tough
**Equipment:**:: Bullseye Lantern, Common Clothes, Handaxe, Light Hammer, Mason’s Tools, Mess Kit, Oil (1 flask), Shovel, Waterskin, 15 GP
Your	apprenticeship	consumed	the	better	part	
of	your	youth.	First,	you	learned	to	cut	and	
polish	a	stone.	After	several	years of	polishing	
stones,	you	learned	how	to	cement	those stones	
into	a	wall. After	several	years	building	walls,	
you	learned	to join	your	walls	to	form	a	
structure.	The	structures	you	built	were	
exceptionally	durable.	The	masons	who	taught	
you	were	taught	by	even	older	masons	who	
were	taught	by	dwarf	artisans	of	old.

**Languages:**:: *Common, Draconic, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Skilled
**Equipment:**:: Fine Clothes, Gaming Set, Perfume, Signet Ring, 24 GP
You	were	raised	in	a	castle	as	a	creature	of	
wealth,	power,	and	privilege—none	of	it	earned.
Your	family	are	minor	aristocrats	who	saw	to	it	
that	you	received	a	first-class	education,	some	
of	which	you	appreciated	and	some	of	which	
you	resented.	(Was	it	truly	necessary	to	read	all	
those	ancient	histories	in	their	original	
Draconic?)	Your	time	in	the	castle,	especially	
the	many	hours	you	spent	observing	your	
family	at	court,	also	taught	you	a	great	deal	
about	leadership.	


#### Pilgrim
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Wisdom, +1 Constitution
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Religion, Survival
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Musical Instrument (one of your choice)
**Languages:**:: *Common, Halfling, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Healer
**Equipment:**:: Bedroll, Healer’s Kit, Holy Symbol, Musical Instrument, Rations (2 days), Traveler’s Clothes, 16 GP
You	and	a	group	of	like-minded	believers—
mostly	humans	and	halflings—once	endeavored	
to	walk	a	thousand	miles	of	road	to	reach	a	
faraway	shrine.	Priests	counseled	at	the	outset	
that,	long	after	your	journey	was	complete,	
you’d	come	to	realize	that	you	found	the	key	to	
your	salvation	not at	your	destination,	but	
somewhere	along	the	road	that	led	there.	


#### Sage
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Arcana, History
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Calligrapher’s Supplies
**Languages:**:: *Common, Elvish, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Magic Initiate (Arcane)
**Equipment:**:: Book (History), Calligrapher’s Supplies, Parchment (8 sheets), Quarterstaff, Robe, 8 GP
You spent	your	formative	years	traveling	
between	manors	and	monasteries,	performing	
various	odd	jobs	and	services	in	exchange	for	
access	to	their	libraries.	You	wiled	away	many	a	
long	evening	with	your	nose	buried	in	books	
and	scrolls,	learning	the	lore	of	the	multiverse—
even	the	rudiments	of	magic—and	your	mind	
only	yearns	for	more.

\column
#### Sailor
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Dexterity, +1 Wisdom
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Acrobatics, Perception
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Navigator’s Tools
**Languages:**:: *Common, Primordial, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Tavern Brawler
**Equipment:**:: Dagger, Fishing Tackle, Navigator’s Tools, Silk Rope, Traveler’s Clothes, 10 GP
Thus	far,	you’ve	spent	most	of	your	days	living	
the	life	of	a	seafarer,	wind	at	your	back	and	
decks	swaying	beneath	your	feet,	as	you	sailed	
toward	your	next	adventure.	You’ve	perched	on	
barstools	in	more	ports	of	call	than	you	can	
remember,	faced	down	mighty	storms,	and	
swapped	stories	with	the	folk	who	live	beneath	
the	waves.


#### Soldier
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Strength, +1 Constitution
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Athletics, Intimidation
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Gaming Set (one of your choice)
**Languages:**:: *Common, Goblin, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Savage Attacker
**Equipment:**:: Arrow (20), Gaming Set (same as above), Healer’s Kit, Quiver, Shortbow, Spear, Traveler’s Clothes, 14 GP
You	began	training	for	war	at	such	an	early	age	
that	you	carry	only	a	precious	few	memories	of	
what	life	was	like	before	you	took	up	arms.	
Battle	is	in	your	blood.	Sometimes	you	catch	
yourself	reflexively	performing	the	basic	
fighting	exercises	you	learned	as	a	youth.	
Eventually,	you	put	that	training	to	use	on	the	
battlefield,	protecting	the	realm	by	waging	war	
and	studying	the	strategies	of	goblinoid	
generals.


#### Urchin
**Ability Scores:**:: +2 Dexterity, +1 Wisdom
**Skill Proficiencies:**:: Insight, Stealth
**Tool Proficiency:**:: Thieves’ Tools
**Languages:**:: *Common, Common Sign Language, any standard language*{color:#D35400} 
**Feat:**:: Lucky
**Equipment:**:: Bedroll, Common Clothes, Dagger (2), Gaming Set
You	grew	up	on	the	streets,	surrounded	by	
similarly	ill-fated	castoffs,	a	few	of	them	friends	
and	a	few	of	them	rivals.	You	slept	where	you	
could and	did	odd	jobs	for	food. At	times,	when	
the	hunger	became	unbearable,	you	resorted to	
theft.	Still,	you	never	lost	your	pride	and	never	
abandoned	hope.	Fate	is	not	yet	finished	with	
you.

# Feats
This chapter details player character feats.
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives
a character special capabilities. It embodies training,
experience, and abilities seperate from what a class provides.

{{note
##### Bonus Feats at 20th Level
A DM can use bonus Feats as a form of
advancement after characters reach 20th level, a
way to provide greater power to characters who
have no more levels to gain. With this approach,
each character gains one Feat of their choice for
every 30,000 XP the character earns above 355,000

## Armor and Shields
{{purple,#book,text-align:left,background:#aa88aa55
Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many
different cultures, each with its own technology level.
For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety
of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain
mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of
arm or in between. The Armor table collects the most
commonly available types of armor found in the game
and separates them into three categories: light armor,
medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors
supplement their armor with a shield.
}}

:::::
##### Armor Training
If	you	wear	Light,	Medium,	or	Heavy	Armor	
and	lack	Armor	Training	with	that	type	of	
Armor,	you	have	Disadvantage	on	any	d20	Test
you	make	that	involves	Strength	or	Dexterity,	
and	you	can’t	cast	Spells.
If	you	equip a	Shield	and	lack	Armor Training
with	Shields,	you	don’t	gain	the	Armor	Class	bonus	of	the	Shield.

#### Getting in and out of Armor
{{purple,#book,text-align:left,background:#aa88aa55
The time it takes to don or doff arm or depends on the armor’s category.
**Don.**:: This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.
**Doff.**:: This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

### Weapon Proficiency
{{background:#aa88aa55
Your	race,	class,	and	feats	can	grant	you	proficiency	
with	certain	weapons	or	categories	of	weapons.	The	
two	categories	are	simple and	martial.	Most	people	
can	use	simple	weapons	with	proficiency.	These	
weapons	include	clubs,	maces,	and	other	weapons	
often	found	in	the	hands	of	commoners.	Martial	
weapons,	including	swords,	axes,	and	polearms,	
require	more	specialized	training	to	use	effectively.	
Most	warriors use	martial	weapons	because	these	
weapons	put	their	fighting	style	and	training	to	best	
use.

Proficiency	with	a	weapon	allows	you	to	add	your	
proficiency	bonus	to	the	attack	roll	for	any	attack	
you	make	with	that	weapon.	If	you	make	an	attack	
roll	using	a	weapon	with	which	you	lack	proficiency,	
you	do	not	add	your	proficiency	bonus	to	the	attack	
roll.
}}

### Weapon Properties
:
##### Light [Weapon Property]
When	you	take	the	Attack	Action on	your	turn
and	attack	with	a Light weapon	in	one	hand,	you	
can	make	one	extra	attack	as	part	of	the	same	
Action.	That	extra	attack	must	be	made	with	a	
different Light	weapon	in	the other	hand,	and	
you	don’t	add	your	Ability	Modifier to	the	extra
attack’s	damage. You	can	make	this	extra	attack	
only	once	on	each	of	your	turns.

# Abilities and Skills
This chapter covers Abilities and Skills.

Six Abilities provide a quick desctiption
of every creature’s physical and mental
characteristics:
• **Strength**,:: measuring physical power
• **Dexterity**,:: measuring agility
• **Constitution**,:: measuring endurance
• **Intelligence**,:: measuring reasoning and memory
• **Wisdom**,:: measuring perception and insight
• **Charisma**,:: measuring force of personality

## D20 Tests
The	term	d20	Test	encompasses	the	three	main	
d20	rolls	of	the	game:	Ability	Checks,	Attack	
Rolls,	and	Saving	Throws. If	something	in	the	
game	affects	d20	Tests,	it	affects	all	three	of	
these rolls.

Whenever	a	player	character	rolls	a	1	for	a	d20	
Test,	that	character	gains	Heroic	Inspiration.

The	DM	determines	whether	a	d20	Test	is	
warranted	in	any	given	circumstance.

*Rules on D20 Tests and Ability Checks are covered in this chapter. For rules specific to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws, see the Combat chapter*{color:#D35400}

## Advantage and Disadvantage
{{purple,#book,text-align:left,background:#aa88aa55
Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you
have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check,
a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens,
you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the
higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use
the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if
you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the
5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers,
you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants
advantage or im poses disadvantage on it, you don’t roll
more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations
grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one
additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage
and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of
them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple
circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants
advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have
neither advantage nor disadvantage.
}}

:
{{purple,#book,text-align:left,background:#aa88aa55
When you have advantage or disadvantage and
something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky
trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one
of the dice. You choose which one.
For example, if a
halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls
a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to
reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through
the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. *Heroic*{color:#D35400} Inspiration <s>(see chapter 4)</s> can also give a character advantage on
checks related to the character’s personality, ideals,
or bonds. The GM can also decide that circumstances
influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant
advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.
}}
:
## Heroic Inspiration
When	you	have	Heroic	Inspiration	(also	called	
Inspiration),	you	can	expend	it	to	give	yourself	
Advantage	on	a	d20	Test.	You	decide	to	do	so	
immediately	after	rolling	the	d20.
#### Gaining Heroic Inspiration
A	player	character	gains	Heroic	Inspiration	if	the	
character	rolls	a	1	for	a	d20	Test.	That	1	must	be	
on	the	d20	used	for	the	test’s	total,	not	on	a	d20	
that	was	rerolled	or	discarded.	This	Heroic	
Inspiration	represents	a	character’s	resolve	to	
do	better	after	fumbling	an	attempt.

The	DM	can	also	award	Heroic	Inspiration	to	a	
player	character	who’s	done	something	that	is	
particularly	heroic	or	in	character.
#### Only one at a Time
You	can	never	have	more	than	one	instance	of	
Heroic	Inspiration.	If	something	gives	you	Heroic	
Inspiration	and	you	already	have	it,	you	can	give	
Heroic	Inspiration	to	a	player	character	in	your	
group	who	lacks	it.


## Ability Check
The	Ability	Check	is	one	of	three	types	of	d20	
Tests.	The	rules	often	call	for	an	Ability	Check,	
and	the	DM	can	also call	for	an	Ability	Check,	
determining	which	ability	to	use	when	a	creature	
attempts	something	(other	than	an	Attack	Roll	or	
a	Saving	Throw)	that	has	a	chance	of	meaningful	
failure.	When	the	outcome	is	uncertain	and	
narratively	interesting,	the	dice	determine	the	
results.

{{pageNumber 40}}
{{footnote PART 2 | ABILITIES & SKILLS}}
\page
The	Ability	Check has	the	following	special	
rules.

### Skills
When	you	make	an	Ability	Check,	the	rules	or	the	
DM	determines whether	a	Skill Proficiency is	
relevant	to	the	check.	If	you	have	a	relevant	Skill	
Proficiency,	you	can	add	your	Proficiency	Bonus	
to	the	roll. For	example,	if	a	rule	refers	to	a	
Strength	Check	(Acrobatics	or	Athletics),	you	can	
add	your	Proficiency	Bonus	to	the	check	if	you	
have	Acrobatics	or	Athletics	Proficiency.

#### Expertise
Expertise	is	a	special	feature	that	enhances	your	
use	of	a	particular	Skill Proficiency.	If	you	gain	
Expertise,	you	gain	it	in one	Skill	in	which	you	
have	Proficiency.	You	can	never	have	Expertise	
in	the	same	Skill	Proficiency	more	than	once.

When	you	make	an	Ability	Check with	a	Skill
Proficiency in	which	you	have	Expertise,	your	
Proficiency	Bonus	is	doubled	for	that	check.

#### Tool Proficiency
If	you	have	Proficiency	with	a	tool,	you	can	add	
your	Proficiency	Bonus	to	any	Ability	Check you	
make	that	uses	that	tool.	If	you	have	Proficiency	
in	the	Skill	that’s	also	used	with	that	check,	you	
have	Advantage	on	the	check	too.	This	means	
you	can	benefit	from	both	Skill	Proficiency	and	
Tool	Proficiency	on	the	same	Ability	Check.

### Action Required
Making	an Ability	Check	requires	you	to	take	an	
Action	unless	a	rule says	otherwise. Several	of	
the	named	Actions—such	as	Hide and	
Influence—include	Ability	Checks.
The	DM	may	override	this	requirement	and	
allow	a	particular	Ability	Check	to	be	made as	
part	of	a	Bonus	Action	or	as	no	Action	at	all.
### Difficulty Class (DC)
The	DM	determines	the	Difficulty	Class	of	an	
Ability	Check	and	can override	a	DC	specified	in	
the	rules.	The	Typical	Difficulty	Class	table	
shows	the	most	common	DCs.
The	default	DC	for	a	check	is	15,	and	it	is	rarely	
worth	calling	for	an	Ability	Check	if	the	DC	is	as	
low	as	5,	unless	the	potential	failure	is	
narratively	interesting.

##### Typical Difficulty Class
| Task Difficulty   | DC | 
|:------------------|:-----:|
| Very Easy         | 5     |
| Easy              | 10    | 
| Medium            | 15    | 
| Hard              | 20    | 
| Very Hard         | 25    |
| Nearly Impossible | 30    |


\column
## Skills
{{purple,#book,text-align:left,background:#aa88aa55
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities,
including skills that a character or a monster can be
proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an
ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill
demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s
starting skill proficiencies are determined at character
creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in
the monster’s stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a
character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm
an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of
Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of
Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has
proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at
Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in
the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.)
See an ability’s description in the later sections of this
chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

**Strength:**:: Athletics
**Dexterity:**:: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth
**Intelligence:**:: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion
**Wisdom:**:: Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival
**Charisma:**:: Deception, Intimidation, Perform ance, Persuasion

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check
using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom
(Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask
the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a
check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an
individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability
checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the
skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

# Interacting with the World
Rules on how players interact with the world.


::::::::
## *Awareness*{color:#D35400}
*This section covers aspects of perception, knowledge, and any other measure of a creatures awareness of the world around them.*{color:#D35400}

### Vision and Light
{{background:#aa88aa55
The	most	fundamental	tasks	of	adventuring—
noticing	danger,	finding	hidden	objects,	hitting	an	
enemy	in	combat,	and	targeting	a	spell,	to	name	just	
a	few—rely	heavily	on	a	character’s	ability	to	see.	
Darkness	and	other	effects	that	obscure	vision	can	
prove	a	significant	hindrance.

A	given	area	might	be	lightly	or	heavily	obscured.	
In	a	**lightly	obscured** area,	such	as	dim	light,	patchy	
fog,	or	moderate	foliage,	creatures	have	
disadvantage	on	Wisdom	(Perception)	checks	that	
rely	on	sight.

A	**heavily	obscured** area—such	as	darkness,	
opaque	fog,	or	dense	foliage—blocks	vision	entirely.	
A	creature	effectively	suffers	from	the	blinded	
condition	(see	appendix	PH-A)	when	trying	to	see	
something	in	that	area.

The	presence	or	absence	of	light	in	an	
environment	creates	three	categories	of	
illumination:	bright	light,	dim	light,	and	darkness.

**Bright	light** lets	most	creatures	see	normally.	
Even	gloomy	days	provide	bright	light,	as	do	torches,	
lanterns,	fires,	and	other	sources	of	illumination	
within	a	specific	radius.

**Dim	light**,	also	called	shadows,	creates	a	lightly	
obscured	area.	An	area	of	dim	light	is	usually	a	
boundary	between	a	source	of	bright	light,	such	as	a	
torch,	and	surrounding	darkness.	The	soft	light	of	
twilight	and	dawn	also	counts	as	dim	light.	A	
particularly	brilliant	full	moon	might	bathe	the	land	
in	dim	light.

**Darkness** creates	a	heavily	obscured	area.	
Characters	face	darkness	outdoors	at	night	(even	
most	moonlit	nights),	within	the	confines	of	an	unlit	
dungeon	or	a	subterranean	vault,	or	in	an	area	of	
magical	darkness.
}}


### Blindsight
If	you	have	Blindsight,	you can	effectively	see	
within	a	specific	range without	relying	on	
physical	sight. Within	that	range,	you	can	
effectively	see	anything	that	isn’t	behind	Total	
Cover,	even	if	you’re	Blinded	or	in	Darkness.
Moreover,	you	can	effectively	see	a	Hidden or	an	
Invisible creature	in	that	range.

\column

### Darkvision
{{background:#aa88aa55
Many	creatures	in	fantasy	gaming	worlds,	especially	
those	that	dwell	underground,	have	darkvision.	
Within	a	specified	range,	a	creature	with	darkvision	
can	see	in	darkness	as	if	the	darkness	were	dim	light,	
so	areas	of	darkness	are	only	lightly	obscured	as	far	
as	that	creature	is	concerned.	However,	the	creature	
can’t	discern	color	in	darkness,	only	shades	of	gray.
}}
:
### Tremorsense
A	creature with	Tremorsense	can	pinpoint	the	
location of	creatures	and	moving	objects within	
a	specific	range,	provided	that	the creature with	
Tremorsense	and anything	it’s	detecting	are	
both	in	contact	with	the	same	surface	(such	as	
the	ground,	a	wall,	or	a	ceiling)	or	the	same	
liquid.

Tremorsense can’t	detect	creatures	or	objects	
in	the	air,	and	Tremorsense	doesn’t	count	as	a	
form	of	sight

### Truesight
{{background:#aa88aa55
A	creature	with	truesight	can,	out	to	a	specific	range,	
see	in	normal	and	magical	darkness,	see	invisible	
creatures	and	objects,	automatically	detect	visual	
illusions	and	succeed	on	saving	throws	against	them,	
and	perceives	the	original	form	of	a	shapechanger	or	
a	creature	that	is	transformed	by	magic.	
Furthermore,	the	creature	can	see	into	the	Ethereal	
Plane.
}}
:
### Cover
{{background:#aa88aa55
Walls,	trees,	creatures,	and	other	obstacles	can	
provide	cover	during	combat,	making	a	target	more	
difficult	to	harm.	A	target	can	benefit	from	cover	
only	when	an	attack	or	other	effect	originates	on	the	
opposite	side	of	the	cover.

There	are	three	degrees	of	cover.	If	a	target	is	
behind	multiple	sources	of	cover,	only	the	most	
protective	degree	of	cover	applies;	the	degrees	
aren’t	added	together.	For	example, if	a	target	is	
behind	a	creature	that	gives	half	cover	and	a	tree	
trunk	that	gives	three-quarters	cover,	the	target	has	
three-quarters	cover.

A	target	with	**half	cover** has	a	+2	bonus	to	AC	and	
Dexterity	saving	throws.	A	target	has	half	cover	if	an	
obstacle	blocks	at	least	half	of	its	body.	The	obstacle	
might	be	a	low	wall,	a	large	piece	of	furniture,	a	
narrow	tree	trunk,	or	a	creature,	whether	that	
creature	is	an	enemy	or	a	friend.

A	target	with	**three-quarters	cover** has	a	+5	
bonus	to	AC	and	Dexterity	saving	throws.	A	target	
has	three-quarters	cover	if	about	three-quarters	of	it	
is	covered	by	an	obstacle.	The	obstacle	might	be	a	
portcullis,	an	arrow	slit,	or	a	thick	tree	trunk.
}}

{{pageNumber 42}}
{{footnote PART 2 | INTERACTING WITH THE WORLD}}
\page
{{background:#aa88aa55
&emsp;A	target	with	**total	cover** can’t	be	targeted	directly	
by	an	attack	or	a	spell,	although	some	spells	can	
reach	such	a	target	by	including	it	in	an	area	of	effect.	
A	target	has	total	cover	if	it	is	completely	concealed	
by	an	obstacle.
}}

:
### Unseen Attackers and Targets
{{background:#aa88aa55
Combatants	often	try	to	escape	their	foes’	notice	by	
hiding,	casting	the	invisibility	spell,	or	lurking in	
darkness.

When	you	attack	a	target	that	you	can’t	see,	you	
have	disadvantage	on	the	attack	roll.	This	is	true	
whether	you’re	guessing	the	target’s	location	or	
you’re	targeting	a	creature	you	can	hear	but	not	see.	
If	the	target	isn’t	in	the	location	you	targeted,	you	
automatically	miss,	but	the	GM	typically	just	says	
that	the	attack	missed,	not	whether	you	guessed	the	
target’s	location	correctly.

When	a	creature	can’t	see	you,	you	have	
advantage	on	attack	rolls	against	it.	If	you	are	
hidden—both	unseen and	unheard—when	you	
make	an	attack,	you	give	away	your	location	when	
the	attack	hits	or	misses.
}}

\column
{{note,color:purple
#### How to run hiding in the UA
**This is an interpretation of the UA rules and is subject to peer review.**

*Who are you hiding from?:*:: Hiding has become a condition. According to the condition text, the creatures you are hidden from are referred to as 'enemies'. This implies that non-enemies may or may not see you, but don't affect your condition and may still be able to target you with line of sight effects.

*Determining Cover:*:: Cover is a one-to-many relationship between you and every other enemy. When checking cover for hiding, use the least applicable cover from all visible enemies. If you are trying to hide while there are no enemies, assume full cover.

*Breaking Line of Sight:*::  A creature can not see you under the following situations: You have Full Cover, you are Heavily Obscured, you have the Hidden Condition, you have the Invisible Condition. In any of these situations, you aren’t affected by any effect from that creature that requires its target to be seen.

*Three-Quarters Cover and No Line of Sight:*:: I honestly don't understand this. If you have 3/4 cover, it means an enemy still has line of sight. I would rule that 3/4 cover never allows hiding because the other hiding requirement can't be fulfilled.

*Unseen Enemies:*:: If you can't see an enemy, but they can see you, you can still succeed on your Hide check. When an unseen enemy that can see you, begins to interact with you while you have the Hidden condition and no cover from that enemy, it immediately ends the hidden condition.

*Revealed:*:: If at any time you lose all cover from a visible enemy and are not heavily obscured, the hidden condition ends.

*Found:*:: If an enemy uses the Search Action to find you with a Wisdom Check (Perception), they must exceed the Stealth check total from your Hide Action. 

*Location:*:: While you have the hidden condition, an enemy may not know your exact location, and must use the rules for guessing the target's location as detailed in the 'Unseen Attackers and Targets' entry.

### *Awareness Actions*{color:#D35400}
:
#### Search [Action]
When	you	take	the	Search	Action,	you	make	a	
Wisdom	Check	to	discern something	that	isn’t	
obvious. The	Search	table	suggests	which	Skills	
are	applicable	when	you	take	this	Action,	
depending	on	what	you’re	trying	to	detect.
##### Search
| Skill | Thing to Detect |
|:------------------|:-----|
| Insight  | Creature’s state of mind  |
| Medicine |Creature’s ailment |
| Perception |Concealed creature or object |
| Survival |Tracks or food |

#### Study [Action]
When	you	take	the	Study	Action,	you make	an	
Intelligence	Check to	study	your	memory,	a	
book,	a	creature,	a	clue,	an	object,	or	another	
source	of	knowledge	and	call	to	mind	an	
important	piece	of	information about	it.

The	Areas	of	Knowledge	table	suggests	which	
Skills	are	applicable	when	you	take	this	Action,	
depending	on	the	area	of	knowledge	the	
Intelligence Check	is	about.
##### Areas of Knowledge
| Skill | Areas |
|:------------------|:-----|
| Arcana        |Spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, planes of existence, and certain creatures (Aberrations, Constructs, Elementals, Fey, and Monstrosities)|
| History       |Historic events and people, ancient civilizations, wars, and certain creatures (Giants and Humanoids)|
| Investigation |Traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry |
| Nature        |Terrain, flora, weather, and certain creatures (Beasts, Dragons, Oozes, and Plants)|
| Religion      |Deities, religious hierarchies and rites, holy symbols, cults, and certain creatures (Celestials, Fiends, and Undead) |

#### Hide [Action]
With	the	Hide	Action,	you	try	to	conceal	yourself.
To	do	so,	you	must make	a	DC	15	Dexterity	
Check	(Stealth) while	you’re	Heavily	Obscured	or	
behind	Three-Quarters	Cover	or	Total	Cover,	and	
you	must	be	out	of	any	visible enemy’s	line	of	
sight;	if	you	can	see	a	creature,	you	can	discern
whether	it can	see	you.

On	a	successful	check,	you	are	Hidden.	Make	
note	of	your	check’s	total,	which	becomes	the	DC	
for	a	creature to	find	you	with	a	Wisdom	Check	(Perception).

### Move
When	you	Move,	you	can	go a	distance	equal	to	
your	Speed	or	less. For	example,	if	you	have	a	
Speed	of	30	feet,	you	can	go up	to	30	feet when	
you	Move. Difficult	Terrain can	slow	you	down.

##### Breaking up your Move
You	can	break	up	your Move,	using	some	of	its	
movement	before	and	after	any	Action	you	take
on	the	same	turn.	For	example,	if	you	have	a	
Speed	of	30	feet,	you	could	go 10	feet,	take	an	
Action,	and	then	go 20	feet.

##### Moving around other Creatures
During	your Move,	you	can	pass	through	the	
space	of	an	ally,	an	Incapacitated creature,	a	Tiny	
creature,	or	a	creature	who	is	two	Sizes	larger	or	
smaller	than	you.

Another creature’s space	is Difficult	Terrain
for	you,	unless	that	creature	is	Tiny.

You	can’t	willingly	end	your	Move	in	a	space	
occupied	by	another	creature.

##### Climbing and Swimming
You	can	use	your	Speed	to	climb	or	swim.	Some	
creatures	also	have	a	Climb	Speed or	a Swim	
Speed.

If you	use	your	Speed	to	climb	or	swim,	each	
foot	of	movement	costs	1	extra	foot.	For	
example,	if	you	swim	or	climb	5	feet,	you	must	
spend	10	feet	of	movement	to	do	so with	your	
Speed. If	you’re	swimming	or	climbing	through	
Difficult	Terrain,	that	5	feet	of	movement	costs	
15	feet!

##### Special Speeds
Some	creatures have	special speeds,	such	as	a	
Climb	Speed,	a	Fly	Speed,	or	a	Swim	Speed.	If	you	
have	more	than	one	speed,	you	must	choose	
which one	to	use	each	time you	take	your	Move.
For example,	if	you	have	a Speed	and	a	Climb	
Speed,	you	can	use	one	of	those	speeds	when	
you	Move,	not	both during	the	same	Move.

If	you	take	more	than	one	Move	on	a	turn	and	
have	more	than	one	speed,	each	Move	can	use	
the	same	speed	or	a	different	one.	For	example,	if	
you	have both a	Speed	and	a	Fly	Speed and	you	
take	the	Dash	Action on	your	turn,	you	could	use	
your	Speed	for	the	Move	and	your	Fly	Speed	for	
the	Dash	or	vice	versa.

##### Speed of 0
If	an	effect	zeroes	your	Speed	for	a	time,	any	
special	speed	you	have	is	also	zeroed	for	the	
same	duration.	For	example,	if	you	have	a	Speed	
and	a	Climb	Speed,	both	speeds	are	zeroed	if	
you’re	subjected	to	the	Grappled Condition.

::

### Difficult Terrain
If	a	space	is	Difficult	Terrain,	every	foot	of	
movement	in that	space	costs	1	extra	foot.	For	
example,	moving	5	feet	through	Difficult	Terrain	
costs	10	feet	of	movement.	Difficult	Terrain	isn’t	
cumulative;	either	a	space	is	Difficult	Terrain	or	
it	isn’t.

A	space	is	Difficult	Terrain for	a	creature if	the	space contains	any	of	the	following: 
- Creature that isn’t Tiny
- Furniture that is Small or larger
- Heavy snow
- Heavy undergrowth
- Ice
- Liquid that’s between shin- and waist-deep (any deeper and you need to Swim)
- Narrow opening that is sized for a creature one Size smaller
- Pit or another gap of 2–5 feet
- Rubble
- Slope of 20 degrees or more
- *Things the DM may determine as Difficult	Terrain*{color:#D35400}

### Climb Speed
A	Climb	Speed	can	be	used	to	move	on	a	vertical	
surface without	expending the extra	movement
normally	associated	with	climbing. A	Climb	
Speed	can	also	be	used	in	any	situation	in	which	
your	Speed	is	usable.

Some	creatures	have	the	Spider	Climb	trait,	
which	allows	their	Climb	Speed	to	work	even	on	
the	underside	of	horizontal	surfaces.

### Swim Speed
A	Swim	Speed	can	be	used	to	move	through	a	
liquid	without	expending	the	extra	movement	
normally	associated	with	swimming

### Fly Speed
A	Fly	Speed	can	be	used	to	move	through	the	air.
While	you	have	a	Fly	Speed,	you	can	stay aloft	
until	you land,	fall,	or	die.

While	flying,	you	fall if	you	are Incapacitated or	
Restrained.	If	you	have the	Hover	trait,	you can	
stay	aloft	even	while	Incapacitated or	Restrained.

### Teleportation
Teleportation	is	a	special	kind	of	magical	
transportation.	If	you	teleport,	you	disappear	
and	reappear	elsewhere	instantly,	without	
moving	through	the	intervening	space.	This	
transportation	doesn’t	expend	movement,	unless	
a	rule	tells	you	otherwise,	and teleportation	
never	provokes	Opportunity	Attacks.

When	you	teleport,	all	the	equipment	you	are	
wearing	and	carrying	teleports	with	you.	

{{pageNumber 45}}
{{footnote PART 2 | INTERACTING WITH THE WORLD}}
\page
If	you	are	touching	another	creature	when	you	
teleport,	that	creature	doesn’t	teleport	with	you,	
unless	the	teleportation	effect	says	otherwise.

If	the	destination	space	of	your	teleportation	is	
occupied	by	another	creature	or	blocked	by	a	solid	obstacle,	you	instead	appear	in	the	nearest	unoccupied	space	of	your	choice.

The	description	of	a	teleportation	effect	tells	
you	if	you	must	see	the	teleportation’s	
destination.

### Movement Actions
:
#### DASH	[Action]
Taking	the	Dash	Action	allows	you	to	make a bonus Move during the current	turn.

#### Jump	[Action]
With	the Jump	Action,	you	attempt	to	leap	more	
than	5	feet (a	jump	of	5	feet	or	less	is	treated	as	
Difficult	Terrain). When	you take	this	Action,	
your	Speed	must	be	greater	than	0,	and you	must
make	a	DC	10	Strength	Check	(Acrobatics	or	
Athletics).	If	you	don’t	Move at	least	10	feet	
immediately	before	this	Action,	you	have	
Disadvantage	on	the	check.

On	a	failed	check,	you	leap	5	feet horizontally	
or	vertically.

On	a	successful	check,	the check’s	total
determines	the	distance	in	feet	that	you	can	clear	
horizontally,	or half	that	total	if	you’re	jumping	
vertically (round	down). This	jump	doesn’t	
expend	your	movement,	but	the	distance	you	
clear	can’t	exceed	your	Speed.

## Interacting with People
:

### Interaction Actions
:

#### Help	[Action]
When	you	take	the	Help	Action,	you	do	one	of	
the	following:
**Assist	Ability	Check.**:: Choose	one	of	your	Skill	Proficiencies and	one	ally	who	can	see	or	hear	you.	You	give Advantage to the	next	Ability	Check	that ally	makes	with	the	chosen Skill.	This	benefit	expires	if	the	ally	doesn’t	use	it	before	the	start	of	your	next	turn. To	give	this	assistance,	you	must	be	near enough	to	the	ally	to	assist	verbally	or	physically when	the	ally	makes	the	check. The	DM	has	final	say	on	whether	your	assistance	is	possible.

#### Influence [Action]
With	the	Influence	Action,	you	can	try	to	
influence another	creature	to	do	something	you	
request	or	demand.	This	Action	can	be	used only	
on	creatures	controlled	by	the	DM,	and	it	isn’t	
mind	control;	it	can’t	force	a	creature	to	do	
something	that	is	counter	to	the	creature’s	alignment	or	that	is	otherwise	repugnant	to	the	creature.

This	Action	has	three	main	parts:	Attitude,	
interaction,	and	a	Charisma	Check.
##### Attitude
A	creature’s	Attitude	determines	how	a	
character	can influence	that creature.	Each	DMcontrolled	creature	has	one	of	the	following	
Attitudes toward	the	player	characters:
**Indifferent.**:: This	is	the	default	Attitude	for	DMcontrolled	creatures.	An	Indifferent creature	might	help	or	hinder	the	party,	depending	on	what	the	creature	sees	as	most	beneficial.	A	creature’s	indifference	doesn’t	necessarily	make	it	standoffish	or	disinterested.	Indifferent	creatures	might	be	polite	and	genial,	surly	and	irritable,	or	anything	in	between.	A	successful	Charisma	Check	is	often	necessary when	the	adventurers	try	to	persuade	an	Indifferent	creature	to	do	something.
**Friendly.**:: A	Friendly creature	wants	to	help	the	adventurers	and	wishes	for	them	to	succeed.	For	tasks	or	actions	that	require	no	particular	risk,	effort,	or	cost,	Friendly	creatures	often help	happily.	If	an	element	of	personal	risk	is	involved,	a	successful	Charisma	Check	might	be	required	to	convince	a	Friendly	creature	to	take	that	risk.
**Hostile.**:: A	Hostile	creature	opposes	the	adventurers	and	their	goals	but	doesn’t	necessarily	attack	them	on	sight.	The	adventurers	need	to	succeed	on	one	or	more	challenging	Charisma	Checks	to	convince	a	Hostile	creature	to	do	anything	on	the	party’s behalf;	however, the	DM	might	determine	that the Hostile	creature	is so	ill-disposed	toward	the	characters that	no	Charisma	Check	can sway	it,	in	which	case	the	first	check fails	automatically	and	no	further	Influence	attempts	can	be	made	on	the	creature	unless	its	Attitude	shifts.


##### Interaction
When	you	take	the	Influence Action,	either	
roleplay	how	your	character	interacts	with	the	
creature or	describe	your	character’s	behavior—
focusing	on	your	character’s request	or	demand.	
If	the	interaction is	especially	suited	to	the	
creature’s	desires	and	outlook,	the	DM	might	
grant Advantage	to your	subsequent	check	or	
might	temporarily	shift	a	Hostile	creature	to	
Indifferent	or	an	Indifferent	creature	to	Friendly.

Similarly,	if	the	interaction is	particularly	
irksome	to	the	creature,	the	DM	might impose	
Disadvantage	on	your	subsequent	check	or	
might	temporarily	shift	a	Friendly	creature	to	
Indifferent	or	an	Indifferent	creature	to	Hostile.

##### Ability Check
To	determine	whether your	request	or	demand	
is	successful,	you	make	a	Charisma	Check
(Animal	Handling,	Deception,	Intimidation,	or	
Persuasion);	the	applicable	Skill	depends	on	the	
interaction,	with	Animal	Handling	being	
reserved	for	Beasts	and	Monstrosities. Also,	each
request	or demand	requires	a different	check.

The	creature’s	Attitude	determines	the	DC	
required	to	achieve	a	specific	response,	as	
shown	in	the	Influence Responses table.
##### Influence Responses
| DC | Indifferent Creature’s Response |
|:------------------|:-----:|
| 10 | The creature does as asked, as long as no risks or sacrifices are involved.     |
| 20 | The creature accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do as asked.| 

| DC | Friendly Creature’s Response |
|:------------------|:-----:|
| 10 | The creature accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do as asked.     |
| 20 | The creature accepts a significant risk or sacrifice to do as asked.| 

| DC | Hostile Creature’s Response |
|:------------------|:-----:|
| 10 | The creature offers no help but does no harm.     |
| 20 | The creature does as asked, as long as no risks or sacrifices are involved.|

## Resting, Eating, Travel
:
### Resting
:
#### Short Rest
{{background:#aa88aa55
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long,
during which a character does nothing more strenuous
than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or m ore Hit Dice at the end
of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number
of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For
each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die
and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The
character regains hit points equal to the total. The player
can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.
A character regains som e spent Hit Dice upon finishing
a long rest, as explained below.
}}
:
#### Long Rest
A	Long	Rest	is	a	period	of	extended	downtime—
at	least	8	hours	long—available	to	any	creature.	
During	a	Long	Rest, you	sleep	for	at	least	6	hours	
and	perform	no	more	than	2	hours	of	light	
activity,	such	as	reading,	talking,	eating,	or	
standing	watch.

##### Benefits of the Rest
When	you	finish a	Long	Rest,	you gain	the	following	benefits:
**Regain	All	HP.**:: You regain	all	lost	Hit	Points.
**Regain	All HD.**:: You	regain	all	spent	Hit	Dice. 
**HP	Max	Restored.**::	If	your Hit	Point	Maximum	was	reduced,	it	returns	to	normal.
**Ability	Scores	Restored.**:: If	any	of	your	Ability	Scores	were	reduced,	they	return	to	normal. You can’t	benefit	from	more	than	one	Long	Rest	in	a	24-hour	period,	and	you must	have	at	least	1	Hit	Point	at	the	start	of	the	rest	to	gain	its	benefits.
##### Interrupting the Rest
If	a	Long	Rest	is	interrupted	by	combat	or	by	1	
hour	of	walking,	casting	Spells,	or	similar	
activity,	the	rest	confers	no	benefit	and	must	be	
restarted;	however,	if	the	rest	was	at	least	1	hour	
long	before	the	interruption,	you	gain the	
benefits	of	a	Short	Rest.

# Combat
This chapter covers rules for combat.

::::::::
## Making an Attack
{{background:#aa88aa55
Whether	you’re	striking	with	a	melee	weapon,	firing	
a	weapon	at	range,	or	making	an	attack	roll	as	part	
of	a	spell,	an	attack	has	a	simple	structure.
**1.Choose	a	target.**:: Pick	a	target	within	your attack’s	range:	a	creature,	an	object,	or	a	location.
**2.Determine	modifiers.**::	The	GM	determines	whether	the	target	has	cover	and	whether	you	have	advantage	or	disadvantage	against	the	target.	In	addition,	spells,	special	abilities,	and	other	effects	can	apply	penalties	or	bonuses	to	your	attack	roll.
**3.Resolve	the	attack.**::	You	make	the	attack	roll.	On	a	hit,	you	roll	damage,	unless	the	particular	attack	has	rules	that	specify	otherwise.	Some	attacks	cause	special	effects	in	addition	to	or	instead	of damage.

If	there’s	ever	any	question	whether	something	
you’re	doing	counts	as	an	attack,	the	rule	is	simple:	if	you’re	making	an	attack	roll,	you’re	making	an	attack.
}}
:

#### Unarmed Strike
An	Unarmed	Strike	is	a	melee	attack	that	
involves	you	using	your	body	to	damage,	
grapple,	or	shove	a	target	within	your	Reach.

Your	bonus	to	hit	with	an	Unarmed	Strike	
equals	your	Strength	modifier	plus	your	
Proficiency	Bonus.	On	a	hit,	your	Unarmed	Strike	
causes	one	of	the	following	effects	of	your	
choice:
**Damage.**:: The	target	takes	Bludgeoning	Damage	equal	to	1	+	your	Strength	modifier.
**Grapple.**:: The	target	is	Grappled,	and	the	grapple’s	escape	DC	equals	8	+	your	Strength	modifier	+	your	Proficiency	Bonus.	This	grapple	is	possible	only	if	the target	is	no	more	than	one	Size	larger	than	you	and	if	you	have	a	hand	free	to	grab	the	target.
**Shove.**:: You	either	push	the	target	5	feet	away	or	knock	the	target	Prone.	This	shove	is	possible	only	if	the	target	is	no	more	than	one	Size	larger	than	you.
\column

## Combat Actions
*While the actions presented here are generally related to combat, they are not restricted to combat. Likewise, actions from other Chapters may be used in combat.*{color:#D35400}

#### Attack	[Action]
When	you	take	the	Attack	Action,	you	can	make	
one	attack	with	a	Weapon	or	an	Unarmed	Strike.

##### Having the Light Weapon Property
When	you	take	the	Attack	Action on	your	turn
and	attack	with	a Light weapon	in	one	hand,	you	
can	make	one	extra	attack	as	part	of	the	same	
Action.	That	extra	attack	must	be	made	with	a	
different Light	weapon	in	the other	hand,	and	
you	don’t	add	your	Ability	Modifier to	the	extra
attack’s	damage. You	can	make	this	extra	attack	
only	once	on	each	of	your	turns.

For	example,	if	you take	the	Attack	Action	on	
your	turn	and	have	a	Shortsword	in	one	hand	
and	a	Dagger	in	the	other—each	of	which	has	the	
Light	property—you	can	make	one	attack	with	
each	weapon,	but	you	don’t	add	your	Strength	or	
Dexterity	Modifier	to	the	damage	roll	of	the	
second	weapon.

##### Equipping Weapons
You	can	equip	or	unequip	one	Weapon	before	or	
after	any	attack	you	make	as	part	of	this	Action,	
even	if	the	attack	is	with	an	Unarmed	Strike.

##### Moving between Attacks
If	you	Move on	your	turn,	you	can	use	some	or	all	
of	that	movement	to	move	between	the	attacks	
of	this	Action	if	you	have	a	feature,	such	as	Extra	
Attack,	that	gives	you	more	than	one	attack	as	
part	of	the	Attack	Action.

#### Help	[Action]
When	you	take	the	Help	Action,	you	do	one	of	
the	following:
**Assist	Attack	Roll.**:: You	momentarily	distract	an	enemy	within	5	feet	of	you,	granting Advantage	to	the	next	Attack	Roll by	one	of	your	allies	against	that enemy.	This	benefit	expires	at	the	start	of	your	next	turn.

::::::::
## What is a Spell?
{{background:#aa88aa55
A	spell	is	a	discrete	magical	effect,	a	single	shaping	of	
the	magical	energies	that	suffuse	the	multiverse	into	
a	specific,	limited	expression.	
}}
:
### Cantrips
{{background:#aa88aa55
A	cantrip	is	a	spell	that	can	be	cast	at	will,	without	
using	a	spell	slot	and	without	being	prepared	in	
advance.	Repeated	practice	has	fixed	the	spell	in	the	
caster’s	mind	and	infused	the	caster	with	the	magic	
needed	to	produce	the	effect	over	and	over.	A	
cantrip’s	spell	level	is	0.
}}
:
### Rituals
If	you	have	a	Spell	prepared	that	has	the	Ritual	tag,	you	can	cast	that	Spell	as	a	Ritual.
{{background:#aa88aa55
Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting,
or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It	also	doesn’t	expend	a	spell	slot,
which	means	the	ritual	version	of	a	spell	can’t	be	
cast	at	a	higher	level.
}}
:
\column
## Casting a Spell
:
### Concentration
{{background:#aa88aa55
Some spells require you to maintain concentration
in order to keep their magic active. If you lose
concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration,
that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell
specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can
end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t
interfere with concentration. The following factors can
break concentration:

- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
- **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.
- **Other Conditions.**{color:#D35400} The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.
}}
## Spellcasting Actions
:
#### Magic	[Action]
When	you	take	the	Magic	Action,	you	cast	a	Spell	
that	has	a	casting	time	of	an Action,	or	you	use	a	
Magic	Item	that	requires	an	Action	to	be	
activated.

If	you	cast	a	Spell	that	has	a	casting	time	of	1	
minute	or	longer,	you	must	take	the	Magic	
Action	on	each	turn	of	that	casting,	and	you	must	
maintain	Concentration	while	you	do	so. If	your	
Concentration	is	broken,	the	Spell	fails,	but	you	
don’t	expend	a	Spell	Slot.

{{note
#### Casting in Armor
If	you	wear	Light,	Medium,	or	Heavy	Armor	
and	lack	Armor	Training	with	that	type	of	
Armor,	you	can’t	cast	Spells.

# Spells
This chapter details the core set of spells.
There are three core	Spell	types:	Arcane,	
Divine,	and	Primal. 

#### Arcane Spells
An	Arcane	Spell	draws	on	the	ambient	magic	of	
the	multiverse.	Bards,	Sorcerers,	Warlocks,	and	
Wizards	harness	this	magic,	as	do	Artificers.	For	
a	partial	list	of	Arcane	Spells,	see	“Spell	Lists”	
below.

#### Divine Spells
A	Divine	Spell	draws	on	the	power	of	gods	and	
the	Outer	Planes.	Clerics	and	Paladins	harness	
this	magic.	For	a	partial	list	of	Divine	Spells,	see	
	“Spell	Lists”	below.

#### Primal Spells
A	Primal	Spell	draws	on	the forces	of	nature	and	
the	Inner	Planes.	Druids	and	Rangers	harness	
this	magic.	For	a	partial	list	of	Primal	Spells,	see	
	“Spell Lists”	below.

## Spell Lists
Each	list	provides	a	Spell’s	
level *(Cantrips are listed as level 0)*{color:#D35400},	name, and	School	of	Magic.	The	list	also	
indicates	whether	a	Spell	has	the	Ritual	tag.

\column
{{note,background:#aa88aa55
#### The Schools of Magic
Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called
schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these
categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in
essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous
study or is bestowed by a deity.

The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no
rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.

**Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some
of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers,
negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures
to other planes of existence.

**Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects
and creatures from one location to another. Some spells
summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas
others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some
conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.

**Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of
secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations
of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of
distant people or places.

**Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing
or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies
see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of
action, or even control another creature like a puppet.

**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a
desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others
channel positive energy to heal wounds.

**Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They
cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things
that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember
things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom
images that any creature can see, but the most insidious
illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.

**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and
death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force,
drain the life energy from another creature, create the
undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells
such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters
use such spells frequently.

**Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature,
object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a
harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an
object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s
innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury

# Appendix A: Conditions
{{background:#aa88aa55
Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in
a variety of ways and can arise as a result of
a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack,
or other effect. Most conditions, such as
blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as
invisible, can be advantageous.
A condition lasts either until it is countered
(the prone condition is countered by standing
up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect
that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a
creature, each instance of the condition has its own
duration, but the condition’s effects don't get worse.
A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.

The following definitions specify what happens to
a creature while it is subjected to a condition.
}}
:
## Blinded
{{background:#aa88aa55
- A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
}}

## Charmed
{{background:#aa88aa55
- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charm er with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.
}}

## Deafened
{{background:#aa88aa55
- A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing
